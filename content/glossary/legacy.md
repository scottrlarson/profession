Denoting software or hardware that has been superseded but is difficult to replace because of its wide use. Also legacy hardware or software can cause unforeseen problems if a operating system depends on new and current features that are part of upgrading. For instance, running legacy software on a new computer with a current operating system might prevent that software from working as expected.
