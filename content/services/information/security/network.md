You can have a home or small business network that is setup with standard consumer equipment using stock configurations used by guests or family members. But you may want to have better security than consumer grade stock configurations allow. You may want to prevent malicious activity, or setup better authentication for users so you can keep your network in good standing and prevent downtime and issues. 

I offer a free estimate consultation to talk with you about your concerns to find a solution that is cost and security effective for the size of your network.
