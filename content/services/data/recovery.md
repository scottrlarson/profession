It's very likely that I can recover data from your damaged device or your data loss. The chances of recovery depend on your storage device: Hard Disk Drive, or Solid State Storage, the state of the damage, if you data was deleted, or wiped.  Its important that you stop using the device immediately after you notice the loss or failure, as further use could prevent a full recovery. I will need to perform a free analysis on the device itself to let you know the possibility and expense of the recovery.

- Data Recovery Turn-Around times can vary from 1 day to 3 weeks depending on my time constraints, and the state of the device itself. If there is physical damage on the device, the particular damage may significantly slow the recovery time.
- I offer a recovery guarantee. You only pay if I can recover the data you actually need.



## Supported Storage Devices

- Hard Disk Drive
- Solid State Storage

{{% service-range item-min="$800" item-max="$3000" %}}
