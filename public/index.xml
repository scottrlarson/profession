&lt;li&gt;#1 - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bleeping ComputerÂ® is a information security and technology news publication created in 2004. Millions of visitors come to BleepingComputer.com every month to learn about the latest security threats, technology news, ways to stay protected online, and how to use their computer more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to news, we provide a wide array of free technical support services, downloads, and self-education tools that allow a user to resolve issues on their computer. Whether you are a novice user here to learn basic concepts about computers or an advanced user infected with ransomware, BleepingComputer can offer custom solutions to your problem for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of it&amp;rsquo;s focuses is also to allow the novice computer to have a place that they can come and discuss computer/technology problems with their peers and at the same time have a rich resource in which to learn the &amp;ldquo;basics&amp;rdquo; about computers and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have found, with extensive experience in helping users that most technical support problems lie not with the computer, but with the fact that the user does not know the &amp;ldquo;basic concepts&amp;rdquo; that underlie all issues of computing. Once a user learns the basic concepts of technology they will be able to express what problems they are having in a more understandable manner, making it easier to be helped by a more experienced user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic concepts of computer technology do not only apply themselves towards fixing problems, but also to every day life. In today&amp;rsquo;s age, computers are here to stay and are only going to be incorporated into our daily life more and more as time goes on. Understanding the basic concepts will allow you to communicate more intelligently about your computer and technology needs and allow you to use your equipment more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, their goal is to turn your #$@!* computer that never does what you want, to one that you praise as a well tamed tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iFixit is a wiki-based site that teaches people how to fix almost anything. Anyone can create a repair manual for a device, and anyone can also edit the existing set of manuals to improve them. The site empowers individuals to share their technical knowledge with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the ifixit site for disassembly reference for laptops. But I also purchase parts from the site I cannot find anywhere else. I support&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check my &lt;a href=&#34;#contact&#34;&gt;hours&lt;/a&gt; for availability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;payment-terms&#34;&gt;Payment Terms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ongoing service rates are determined by the immediacy, or the day/time a service is requested. Services that require a faster turn-around time are priced higher than services that can wait. I also offer flat rates, price ranges and quotes for project based services. For in-shop services, if you require a more specific out-the-door cost and want to know more about what kinds of services I offer, check the main menu of my website.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I offer discounts for Senior Citizens, Non-profits, Non-business Residential, and Homeless customers for all my services upon request. &lt;a href=&#34;#contact&#34;&gt;Call, Text or Visit&lt;/a&gt; my office for more info.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I accept cash, check, or credit card via paypal using the mobile app, or online website. Payments are due before the device is released, or before I leave the service location. The exception is if I have an on-going relationship with you as the business owner to provide a service, or I draw up a proposal/quote for an on-going project. In this case the max payment cycle is two weeks. Please be prepared to pay me for my time after the work requested is complete. Not having the proper payment method, or amount, may halt any work in progress, prevent me from starting any work, or prevent you from picking up your device. Payments that are late incur a $0.50 charge per day and payments late over 30 days has a %20 fee of the total cost of the service (On top of the daily fee) per month.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I only provide services directly to individuals/people, and individuals/people who operate small operations with 10 or less employees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is about my experience with the first home computers. My history starts with gaming on the consoles of the time, starting with the Atari 2600. I played games like &amp;ldquo;Raiders of the Lost Ark&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Donkey Kong&amp;rdquo;. When the first Home Computers were released, I played one of the first dungeon crawlers, &amp;ldquo;Tunnels of Doom&amp;rdquo; on the TI99/4A. After the Commodore 64 was released, I played games like &amp;ldquo;Wasteland&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Ultima IV&amp;rdquo;.  Most of my surviving memories center around the Commodore Amiga. What memories of your game history has survived the aging process? Games like &amp;ldquo;Another World&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Flashback&amp;rdquo; bring me back to a time of story-driven 2D side-scrollers, with the first use of cinematic cut scenes. I also touch on the era of the BBS.  Computers hosting Bulletin Board System software were the first forum like experience allowing enthusiasts to communicate with each other. Finally, I recall my experiences with the first 3d Modeling applications on the Amiga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a journey back in history with me. The year is 1982, just after one of the first home computers was released, the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A. I was about 12 years old. Relatively expensive, but affordable to many middle-class families, Home Computers ranged around a thousand dollars in value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the introduction of the first models, my family and I did not have a home computer, but fortunately, I had friends. A friend&amp;rsquo;s mother, who wanted to keep her son out of trouble, purchased the 99/4a for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend Rob and I would visit Andy&amp;rsquo;s house on the weekends and act like we knew all about computers. The game I vividly remember playing, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Tunnels of Doom&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; became the hot title at the time. As far as I know, it was the first multi-player turn-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_crawl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;dungeon crawler&lt;/a&gt;. We started our morning loading our previously save game data from cassette tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/memorials/personal-computers/ti994a-program-recorder.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;PHP2700 Program Recorder&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At dinner time our game would be loaded. We each took our respective turns exploring a procedurally generated dungeon, engaging in battles with monsters, and restoring fallen comrades. I remember it being the first continuous game experience where I learned to cooperate with other players to complete objectives that spanned more than one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/oa7MYYmB4XQ&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34; title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years after my experience with the TI994a, my parents noticed my enthusiasm for computing. I think they saw the home computer as a step up from my childhood dream of getting myself into trouble at school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;panel-group&#34; id=&#34;accordion&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;panel panel-default&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;panel-heading-tooltip&#34;&gt;
      &lt;span class=&#34;panel-title-tooltip&#34;&gt;
        &lt;a data-toggle=&#34;collapse&#34; data-parent=&#34;#accordion&#34; href=&#34;#collapse-electronics-history&#34;&gt;Did you know?: My Uncle introduced me to electronics theory and practicalities?&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;collapse-electronics-history&#34; class=&#34;panel-collapse collapse&#34;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&#34;panel-body&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a brief introduction into electronics theory and practicalities by my Uncle Jim, who worked as an electrician in WWII, and later became a city electrician. When my parents went away on vacation, they would ship me to Chicago to visit my Uncle. He showed me the basics of AC/DC. A few years of my life were spent in his basement, building small electronic devices together. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why I jump at the prospect of getting my hands on newly released gadgets today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as electronics go, the computer is a different beast. The inner workings of a computer operate on the same principles of electric current. But what makes home computers different from electronics is the software programming aspect of it. Programming is like creating a list of instructions for something to happen. At the end of the day, is all about flipping switches. Flipping a sequence of switches actually, in a way the computer can understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This enthusiasm got me my first computer, a Commodore 64. I&amp;rsquo;m skipping the part where my real first computer was a TRS-80.  Back then, it was considered the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dfarq.homeip.net/trash-80-what-it-meant-and-why-it-stuck/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Trash-80&lt;/a&gt; by my compadres. It was as good of a computer as any during that time, except for its initial limitations that could be expanded with add-on hardware, making the cost significantly larger than the original price of the product. It&amp;rsquo;s very similar to how computer games ship nowadays, half-completed, then sold the completed parts of the game in expansions. This half-computer developed a bad reputation for not being a complete experience. You couldn&amp;rsquo;t do much with it without upgrading the hardware and I convinced my mom to upgrade the computer, lots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, forget I ever said anything about the Trash-80, we move on to big and better things in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/memorials/memorial-my-home-computer-reflections-part-2/&#34;&gt;next part&lt;/a&gt; of this series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commodore, instrumental in launching the Home Computer movement forward, focused on low-cost alternatives to the mainframe/supercomputer, high-priced market that the juggernauts HP and IBM were involved in at the time. Many people in the business world considered home computers toys and they would never gain the status and profitability of designing computers for the corporate world. Because of this mindset, there was a lot of controversy around the introduction of the home computer, with back-biting executives sabotaging projects to CEOs running projects into the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took people like Commodore&amp;rsquo;s Founder Jack Tramiel who understood where technology was heading to shift the tide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We build computers for the masses, not the classes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
- Jack Tramiel (Commodore&amp;rsquo;s Founder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;breakoutBox1&#34;&gt;For more commodore gushiness on the impact of Commodore and it&amp;rsquo;s how its home Computer revolution affected the computers of today, read an introduction: &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bitmapbooks.com/blogs/news/back-to-basic-understanding-the-dazzling-legacy-of-the-commodore-64&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Understanding the dazzling legacy of the C64&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C64 was my first computer, if you were using computers at the time, it was likely your first computer too. Simplicity, low cost, superior graphics, quality sound, good game software, and aggressive marketing made the C64 the perfect home computer for enthusiasts like me and many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tinkering communities formed around the C64&amp;rsquo;s simple design and broad software support. It was a bit like the cassette tape area. We became fascinated with the C64&amp;rsquo;s capabilities by testing the limits of hardware, playing with software that did cool things, and sharing it with the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The C64 inspired a whole slew of independent software designed by people for people, who ultimately just wanted to share their creations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/memorials/personal-computers/commodore-amiga-500-old-school.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Commodore Amiga 500 Photo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the first mission to the moon, the technology behind the Amiga 500 Home Computer changed everything. The A500 had its beginnings at Atari. An engineer, Jay Miner, had an idea to develop a computer that would revolutionize games and make them much easier to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too afraid of losing money, Atari corporate executives of that time put little-to-no energy into paradigm-shifting innovations. This decline was in the process of causing the game console industry to collapse. Game development relied heavily on licensing expensive hardware. Due to the fear of losing those licensing deals, Atari prohibited Jay from perusing this new platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realizing the writing on the wall, Jay left Atari. A previous co-worker contacted him and eventually helped him revive the idea under a new company. The technology behind the A500&amp;rsquo;s hardware design was revolutionary, beyond anything that was developed at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One could say it felt like technology from a future time, as it took years for the rest of the industry to catch up. Suddenly, no longer bound to monochrome displays and single-tone beeps, studio-quality video, and sound became a reality.  Eventually, Commodore bought the platform and marketed the Amiga to creative people. The A500 became a big hit with computer enthusiasts and entertainment professionals all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;collapse-electronics-history&#34; class=&#34;panel-collapse collapse&#34;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&#34;panel-body&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the almost-lost home computer revolution, there are other areas in technology today that are stagnating. One such area is how proprietary software is preventing the evolution of technology. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ipwatchdog.com/2022/08/28/software-ownership-is-killing-innovation-controversial-author-calls-for-a-reboot/id=151077/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting source on this subject. I plan on writing a future article about this subject and for now, this is a placeholder for that content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;expandability&#34;&gt;Expandability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big selling points of Home Computers was upgradability. Game consoles purchased for the home during that time were solid units, meaning the design principles were static and the hardware couldn&amp;rsquo;t be changed after the unit was manufactured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The A500 was one of the first computers released with an open design principle, allowing expandability. It had two expansion slots that accepted hardware expansion devices like hard drives and other peripherals. Also, instead of all the chips being soldiered into the mainboard directly, the chips were mounted onto bases so they could be easily removed and replaced when improved chips became available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of open architecture was a first for computer enthusiasts, similar to the concept of modularity, parts could be removed, replaced, and upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, that was what really made home computers interesting. I increased my understanding of electronics by exploring its inner workings and expanding its capabilities. This kind of tinkering spurred my continued computer knowledge over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;panel-group&#34; id=&#34;accordion&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;panel panel-default&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;panel-heading-tooltip&#34;&gt;
      &lt;span class=&#34;panel-title-tooltip&#34;&gt;
        &lt;a data-toggle=&#34;collapse&#34; data-parent=&#34;#accordion&#34; href=&#34;#collapse-&#34;&gt;Did you ever wonder if we are doomed to repeat the past?&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;collapse-&#34; class=&#34;panel-collapse collapse&#34;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&#34;panel-body&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without this kind of open access to the hardware, I would have never learned how to service computers. Currently, some current mobile technology like phones, tablets, and laptops are being designed around the static and unchanging aspects of the  1980s console era, creating a throw-away culture, completely dependent on for-profit companies that have no interest in open platforms. Consider supporting the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.repair.org/stand-up&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;right to repair&lt;/a&gt; movement and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.endcreativemonopolies.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ending creative monopolies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-graphical-user-interface-gui&#34;&gt;The Graphical User Interface (GUI)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Graphical User Interface changed how a computer is operated. It was the first time I realized I could be creative without having to code. I realized that I could create art with a computer through the gestures of my hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I experienced the GUI for the Amiga OS for the first time, I immediately shifted directions. I like the concepts of programming and electronics, but I am much more of a visual person so I started getting familiar with the new graphics, 3d modeling, and audio tools that were being released at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a GUI to interact with a computer is like an extension of human perception. As humans, we interact with our environment through the senses. Like an extension between the body and mind, the more intuitive the tool, the more fluid and imaginative one can be with the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagination and creativity impact how the world is perceived. The A500 inspired a whole slew of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.indiegamewebsite.com/2018/10/19/the-complete-history-of-indie-games/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;creative endeavors&lt;/a&gt; in more creative fields than I can count. Because of this innovation, modern computer technology owes its beginnings to The Amiga platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we go back to the C64 days, computers received instructions from a Command Line Interface (CLI), I.E typing commands to launch programs and work with everyday tasks. There were some limited GUI interfaces that you could load on top of the CLI, but nothing on the scale that the A500 implemented into its operating system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole OS was grounded in a GUI from start to finish, way before the release of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Windows. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to quantify the impact the GUI had on my life, but switching from a lifetime of CLI to a GUI is like miraculously being able to see after years of being blind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This innovation accelerated the adoption of computers.  For many people that might have been put off by the command line, Graphic User Interface systems made using computers more intuitive and helped to spawn a golden age of digital art and sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is the third and final part of a three part series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Part 3: Amiga Games, The BBS Days &amp;amp; 3d Modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Amiga platform brought amazing capabilities in visuals and sound, beyond anything I experienced beforehand. Since I am a big fan of Science Fiction, and I believe that art informs humanity about our past and future, the games created during this time ignited my imagination with possibilities for the future of society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My gaming experience on the Amiga platform inspired me to invest my time and energy into graphic design.  When the first 3D modeling software was released for the Amiga Platform, I was one of its first adopters. Later in life, this field engaged my interest in film and finally writing for film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;amiga-games-that-influenced-my-life&#34;&gt;Amiga games that influenced my life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The days of Future Wars, Another World &amp;amp; Flashback&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/memorials/games/delphine-software/future-wars/futurewars-cover.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Future Wars&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1989 I played &lt;strong&gt;Future Wars&lt;/strong&gt;, a science fiction adventure game released on the Amiga Platform. I was never a big fan of point-and-click adventure games, but the science-fictional aspects of the game captivated me and brought the world of storytelling into focus at a time when most games were about high scores and shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future Wars might not have been an amazing success like other games at the time, but I love exploring the concept of time travel. What inspired me about the game is the sound, made possible by the Amiga platform. Sound was a big thing for games back then, which was very limited by the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, sound and storytelling helped me to continue to explore my interests in science, leading to interpersonal contemplation of what the future might be like. Great for my own storytelling as I developed an interest in writing for film. I developed an interest in temporal mechanics and cognitive theory, both of which helps shape my understanding of the world today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subjects I write about all have their roots in how objective reality and perception have effects on the human mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/GGNTiMET244&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34; title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years later &lt;strong&gt;Another World&lt;/strong&gt; came out. I was in a game store at the time. I picked up this title and looked at the front and back cover. It looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/memorials/games/delphine-software/another-world/amiga-anotherworld-front.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Another World Amiga Game Box Front Cover Photo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/memorials/games/delphine-software/another-world/amiga-anotherworld-back.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Another World Amiga Game Box Back Cover Photo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of some guy lost and stranded on a foreign planet resonated with me. Probably because I feel that way sometimes on earth :P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the first time I saw three dimensional perspective used in a game. Later I found out the developer used rotoscoping to create the cut-scenes. Remember this is a 2d scrolling game mind you. If my memory serves me correctly, 3D perspective in 2d scrolling games was something not even considered at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/memorials/games/delphine-software/another-world/another-world-4-shot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Another World In-Game Screenshot&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/0iz9PJbs5rE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34; title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years later, &lt;strong&gt;Flashback&lt;/strong&gt;, a game by the same publisher was released that had a similar feel to Another World, but in its own right, it was its own game. The game followed a similar theme that I was attracted to, A single protagonist, stranded somewhere, must find his way back to himself. Again, both of these games are side scrollers with mixed cutscenes. I enjoyed playing these games for the cut-scenes as the story elements were similar to movies I had seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/memorials/games/delphine-software/flashback/flashback-in-game-screenshot.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Flashback&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 FANTASTIC Flashback Facts

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/kl7C3DwjTd8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34; title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flashback Soundtrack

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/3VXBjg7Nxto&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34; title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Another World and Flashback had great instrumental soundtracks. Music, with atmospheric sound effects, helped me focus on the action in the game, but it also helped me connect with my surroundings, and from that point on, I used music to help me focus on my creative efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing these particular games was the first time I experienced linear storytelling and that helped me figure out why I was so inspired by stories. I realized that storytelling, in the way it was presented in games, as interactive pieces, was a way for me to focus my own decision-making in life. As I learned how to make decisions in games, I realized with the right focus and intention, I could make sound choices in my own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWgXz2PRrTk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Fallout 3 Ambient Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; is a perfect example of how ambiance can focus attention&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/memorials/personal-computers/amiga2k1-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Commodore Amiga 2000 Photo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon realizing the power of the Amiga platform for graphics and sound, I wanted to do more with the technology than just play games. So I purchased an Amiga 2000 with some inheritance money I had to explore the cutting-edge capabilities of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that time, Commodore shifted its marketing strategies to appeal directly to creative small businesses. In the early 1990s, many independent professionals started to take notice of the platform when the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Toaster&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Video Toaster&lt;/a&gt; was released.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/seznQmDp2pU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;&#34; allowfullscreen frameborder=&#34;0&#34; title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The toaster allowed you to combine graphic capabilities with real-world captured video, something TV stations were moving toward anyway. Before the release of the Toaster, a TV station would spend at least 10,000 if not more on hardware to make this dream a reality. But now, it was being put into the hands of independent artists. This move spawned a whole new era of creative markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3d-modeling-on-the-amiga-2000&#34;&gt;3D modeling on the Amiga 2000&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My interests in 3d modeling and animation (Now called special effects) centered around the work behind the games Another World and Flashback. I purchased an Amiga 2000 solely for that purpose. &lt;strong&gt;Caligari&lt;/strong&gt; which was later renamed to &lt;strong&gt;Truespace 3d&lt;/strong&gt; was the application at the time designed for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to recreate in 3d what I saw in those 2d side-scrolling games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;img style=&#34;margin-bottom: 5px;&#34; src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/memorials/models/rylon-head.png.jpg&#34;
       alt=&#34;My rendition of the Another World Creature&#34;&gt;
  &lt;center style=&#34;margin-bottom: 60px;&#34; class=&#34;image-caption-title&#34;&gt;My rendition of the Another World Creature&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With the realization that special effects would become the future of film and other forms of creative projects, being a part of this movement would be important for my artistic development. But when I saw the kind of work environments that were created around these industries, the long work hours and the destructive corporate culture, I decided to take the byway of self-development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was already somewhat knowledgeable about hardware I figured my skills were more marketable as a one-man show. Besides, at the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t work well with others. In hindsight, the judgments I made about the world, stunted my artistic growth. Or at least the impact I might have made on society by being a part of something bigger than what my mind could imagine. But its never too late for anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work in this type of isolation did have strong points, It helped me shape my ideas and bring some of my ideas to life, which inspired me to get into writing for film, instead of creating works of art that revolved around the creations of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bulletin-board-system-bbs-the-modem&#34;&gt;Bulletin Board System (BBS) &amp;amp; The Modem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, we used our traditional phone lines to dial-in and connect to Bulletin Board Systems. BBSs were the first forums of the day. The Dial-ups of the time were usually single connection based but improved over time. One call after the other, users imprinted themselves upon the walls of life in this early digital stratosphere.  Before the Internet became a reality, BBS systems were our knowledge centers. Built by the users, for the users, of the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I became a user of Bulletin Board Systems during my early C64 days, I was around 13 years of age.  Probably because my parents were in the process of splitting up, I sometimes found it hard to reign in my emotions and be civil. At the time, I found myself in trouble with the social contracts on some of the BBSs I was a member of. Back then, codes of conduct still applied in the digital world and I would find my account suspended for a time which tended to cut me off from online socialization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I got on with life and grew up somewhat. After a while, I purchased a Commodore 128 and ran my BBS, and became a SysOP (Systems Operator).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were a SysOp at the time, you had a unique glimpse into the future of online communication. Because of the time we were in, society was still in its early stages of individual expression. Much of our way of life was affected by our social mores and peer pressure to maintain a facade of being something everyone expected us to be. To fit into society, that&amp;rsquo;s what we did, at least in America. But as an early SysOP, I noticed that BBS users would drop these disguises and reveal who they truly were, or at least who they wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;panel-group&#34; id=&#34;accordion&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;panel panel-default&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;panel-heading-tooltip&#34;&gt;
      &lt;span class=&#34;panel-title-tooltip&#34;&gt;
        &lt;a data-toggle=&#34;collapse&#34; data-parent=&#34;#accordion&#34; href=&#34;#collapse-&#34;&gt;The Lost Civilization of Dial-Up Bulletin Board Systems - By Benj Edwards&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;collapse-&#34; class=&#34;panel-collapse collapse&#34;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&#34;panel-body&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben recalls having a vivid, recurring dream. He climbs the stairs in his parent&amp;rsquo;s house to see his old bedroom. In the back corner, he hears a faint humming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this dream, his old computer, still running his 1990s-era bulletin board system (BBS, for short), âThe Cave.â. He had thought he had shut it down ages ago, but somehow it was still chugging away all this time without him realizing it. People continued calling his BBS to play games, post messages, and upload files. To his astonishment, it never shut down after all&amp;hellip; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Read more about his experience with the BBS era&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Maybe this understanding started me down the path of being able to remain authentic to who I was even under extreme pressure from the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early BBS&amp;rsquo;s were the first type of systems where there was real interaction between people online, way before the internet. Connecting and sharing your innermost dreams happened at a turtle&amp;rsquo;s pace because only one person was able to connect to a BBS at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was unique because you could leave something behind of yourself in a post, and someone might comment on your post hours or days later. It helped me develop my thoughts about the world using a methodical and deterministic model, which sometimes I think we lack in the modern era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BBSs continued to be used during the revolution of the Amiga platform. Although I vaguely remember any significant changes to BBS systems after the C64/128 days, except for the multi-user communication aspect which I lost touch with for a time, not much seemed to change. Being a SysOP helped me connect with other people that had similar interests. I met two people Henry Tilton and Tom Knox, both of who have made their own way into our modern world of computers. I became lifelong friends with these guys, even though I lost track of them over the years, but recently have been getting reacquainted with them, I will never forget their contribution to my learning. Thank you guys, you taught me so much about programming and computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was this feeling of strangers working together to make the world a better place and to create cool things. It was the beginning and in some ways, the end of an era, all at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dial a BBS from an Amiga in 2016&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; padding-top: 30px; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-fall-of-commodore&#34;&gt;The fall of Commodore&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the 1980&amp;rsquo;s Commodore, as a company, was struggling to keep up with the technological advancements being made by the competition. Commodore&amp;rsquo;s corporate internal problems prevented them from making the innovations necessary to stay ahead. You can read more about that in the Ars Series &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arstechnica.com/series/history-of-the-amiga/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;History of the Amiga&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Eventually, Apple and the PC clones of the world started to catch up to our little alternate reality. I remember that the platform wasn&amp;rsquo;t evolving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software development was be being limited by the available hardware at the time. Getting tired of waiting for Commodore to get its act together, I switched over to a PC platform and never looked back, until now. I hope to devote some of my time to checking out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vivn-ek8WY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amiga A500 Mini&lt;/a&gt; with my friend Tom when I visit in Dec and I hope to get more involved in preserving computer history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;appointments&#34;&gt;Appointments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you require an at-location or in-shop consultation &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#contact&#34;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; to make an appointment.  Please note that making appointments with me require both of us to be prompt and communicative about delays/cancellations ahead of time by at least 2hrs. If I fail to show up for our appointment I will wave the first hour of the consultation.  If I am late for an appointment over 10mins I will take %25 off your fee. If you fail to show up you agree to pay the first 1 hour of consultation fee. If you fail to contact me, or contact me under 2hrs before the consultation about a delay/cancellation, or show up late, you agree to a %25 addition to the fee. Please see my &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#rates&#34;&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;service-authorization&#34;&gt;Service Authorization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You authorize my service when you bring in your device, request service via other means, for instance, but not limited to, an E-mail or Phone request. I will have you approve the service by an Authorization or Service Order Form. You can approve this authorization or order by signature or email response. Your approval can happen in a phone conversation with me or an electronic/letter communication but I usually confirm that authorization with a follow up Authorization or Service Order Form. When you authorize a service, I have a responsibility to provide you a reliable experience which usually results in a successful outcome. There are certain conditions that fall out of my responsibility and liability to you, like inadvertent data loss, or hardware failures while servicing a device. Data loss can happen while Encrypting/Decrypting, scanning a file system of a storage device, while diagnosing, repairing, or replacing hardware and/or software. I rely on you to protect your investment by maintaining backups of your data before requesting service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;responsible-communication&#34;&gt;Responsible Communication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its very important to me that I provide the best possible service and that means that after I completed my service on your device, I want to return your device to you in a timely manner. I rely on you to provide me with timely responses to my requests, especially if you require a quick turn-around on the service of your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain cases, failure to follow up on my request for communication in a timely manner may increase the estimated turn-around time and if the delays in communication significantly impacts my work flow, I reserve the right to charge additional fees outside any fees I quoted or estimated to you to compensate me for any over-use of my bench time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless my work schedule is nearing the end of the day, I will respond to communications within three hours, or less. There are a few exceptions to this time frame: If I am on a emergency appointment where I cannot get away, I am on vacation, I am out sick, or it is during off hours. If I am occupied with any of these situations,  I will respond to any and all communications on the next business day. My home page should have a post with a status update on my availability if something happens that prevents me from operating inside of my normal working hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fees&#34;&gt;Fees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluations&lt;/strong&gt; (10min, in-shop only) are free. Please note, &lt;strong&gt;an evaluation is a quick guesstimate, based on my experience, of what the problem might be, and the costs involved&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s not a precise result. If I communicate any costs to you during this evaluation, they are estimates of what costs might be, and not precise quotations. If you want an accurate assessment/diagnostic, quote of costs, request a full diagnostic/assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic fees&lt;/strong&gt; cover my time in troubleshooting an issue, and for me to provide you with a expert report on what I think the problem is based on my observations, or for me to provide you with a recommendation in the event the device is unable to be repaired due to time or cost. Diagnostic fees are paid upfront before the service is rendered, or, in the case of a at-location appointment, upon completion of an assessment, diagnostic, or survey/estimate in cash or check form, with the option (at my discretion) of using your Venmo or Paypal mobile app at my office when you drop off your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repair fees&lt;/strong&gt; are usually in addition to any diagnostic fees and are paid when the repair is complete, before you pick up your device, or before I leave your location in cash or check form, with the option (at my discretion) of using your Venmo or Paypal mobile app at my office when you pick up your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consultation fees&lt;/strong&gt; are per-hour, with a one hour minimum, REGARDLESS OF THE RESULTS of the service. Paid in cash or check form, with the option (at my discretion) of using your Venmo or Paypal mobile app before I leave your location. There are cases where because of some 3rd party issue is not resolve or if something  that is required for me to finish the service is not present at the time of the visit, I will either charge you a full visit fee and if I have to return on another busines day charge you a half-fee for that visit, or at my discretion charge you a half-fee for the initial visit and charge you the remainder when I return. The latter is usually done in cases where the location is at a very short distance (walking).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research/Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt; fees cover my time in creating a estimate/quote, or communicating recommendation information at your request. The fees are charged per project or per request. Payment can be in cash or check form, with the option (at my discretion) of using Venmo or Paypal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project/Service fees&lt;/strong&gt; are set fees that I charge for specific projects or services that I know are going to be fixed turn-around times. The fees are charged per project. Payment can be in cash or check form, with the option (at my discretion) of using your Venmo or Paypal mobile app at my office or before I leave your location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please be prepared to pay cash or check if you unable to get your mobile app working.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;payments&#34;&gt;Payments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All payments can be made via &lt;strong&gt;check or cash&lt;/strong&gt;. If you prefer to pay by credit card, you can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;paypal.me/scottrlarson&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;paypal&lt;/a&gt; me, or [venmo me]&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://account.venmo.com/u/scottrlarson&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://account.venmo.com/u/scottrlarson&lt;/a&gt;) at @scottRlarson. On Venmo, my handle is connected to the business part of their service. So if you do not see my listing, switch to the business tab. &lt;strong&gt;All payments are due immediately upon the return of the device&lt;/strong&gt;, for at-location services, &lt;strong&gt;before I leave the service location&lt;/strong&gt;. For online services, &lt;strong&gt;two weeks after you receive a bill of service&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;My rates for at location services are per-hour with a one-hour minimum regardless of the result&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have an expectation of a result that goes beyond my terms, please communicate that upfront, before any services I provide. You are liable for all payments after the service is started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notice-about-late-or-unpaid-payments&#34;&gt;Notice about late or unpaid payments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a $1.00 fee (Per Day) for late payments. Too many late or unpaid bills will result in services being halted at a time of my discretion, or your service will be re-prioritized for timely paid customers. &lt;strong&gt;Repeated late or unpaid bills will result in the termination of the service relationship.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are outstanding payments, or if I suspect that there might be a situation where they payment method you used to pay me for my services might be returned or charged back, I will retain your equipment until the service is paid, or in the case of a concern with the payment method, until I receive written conformation that the payment I received will not be rescinded after your equipment returned. Any equipment left behind for over a period of 120 days will be destroyed/recycled. You agree that any equipment you leave behind may be sold to cover any outstanding payments not received within 60 days of the bill of service date. You understand that all personal data will be irrevocably destroyed to protect your privacy. If you leave behind a device for servicing, Scott Larson will make every effort to contact you, but if you are not reachable via Phone, Email or Post within this time frame, regardless of the reason, you are giving up ownership of your equipment. You also understand that or you fail/refuse to pay me for my services with in 60 days of the bill of service, after I destroy the data on the device to protect your privacy, I will sell that equipment to cover my loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remote-service&#34;&gt;Remote Service&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you bring your device in for servicing, after a repair, or when you agree to allow me to remotely manage your device&amp;rsquo;s security, backup or upkeep, I may install certain applications/shortcuts on your desktop that help provide ongoing services or to maintain a business relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that remote service requires exceptions to be configured in any security software that is installed on your computer. If you do not trust me or do not want to make these exceptions to your security software, I will not be able to provide any remote services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With your permission, and with your interaction, remote software works by allowing a specific individual, like myself, to access parts of your computer. It&amp;rsquo;s designed to limit access to the technician, like myself. Even though I take every precaution to protect the security of your device and your data during remote sessions and setting up remote software, its setup and use is, may open your computer up to a skilled attacker. You understand that in allowing me to remotely access your computer, you take full responsibility and liability for any unintended results that may happen as a result of some form of exploitation of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are a list of software I use and may install on your device/s and you can uninstall these applications (&lt;b&gt;Excep for Bitdefender GravityZone Small Business Security&lt;/b&gt;) at any time if you feel you do not need them. If you have an ongoing service with me, you might want to make contact with me first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bitdefender.com/business/products/gravityzone-small-business-security.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bitdefender GravityZone Small Business Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: A security package that helps protect your device from threats. I ususally install this product as part of an ongoing service contract, by your request, to manage the security of your device. To protect your device from attackers, &lt;b&gt;this software &lt;u&gt;cannot&lt;/u&gt; be uninstalled without my interaction&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zoho.com/assist/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zoho Assist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Remote control software that helps me connect to your computer remotely to help you with a problem or maintain your device. There are two types of Zoho Assist:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zoho.com/assist/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zoho Assist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which only works when you request help and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zoho.com/assist/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Zoho Assist Unattended Agent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows me to connect to your device without your interaction. I only use this software to provide a requested service to you. I usually install the unattended agent only on a device that is under a system care/management agreement. I only make remote connections to your device with your knowledge and consent, usually under a pre-arranged appointment, unless an agreement is in place to perform a service in another fashion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;protecting-your-data&#34;&gt;Protecting Your Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I make every effort to protect your data, but I am  not responsible nor liable for preserving your data, or knowing what kind of data existed before the servicing of any device.&lt;/strong&gt; I perform a bare metal imaging backup of your device a before a start a service. If something goes wrong with a servicing, I can use this backup to restore the computer to its original configuration. My backups are for internal use and done for safety reasons only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that whatever data was on the device, completely gets restored from my safety backup. Due to the way in which my backup software takes a snapshot of the entire storage device and through my own private verification processes to confirm the image is intact after the back up, there is no possibility of data loss at any point during my safety backups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you receive your device back after servicing and notice a loss of data, look to your backups, or verify the data did not get moved to another location. Also, I only keep this backup for up to 4 months after the servicing to protect your data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important that you do not rely on my backups because you could misplace, or forget where your data lives and assume data is lost when, in fact, it didn&amp;rsquo;t exist on the device in the first place, or it got moved before your device entered into my possession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always important to make your own backups, and maintain knowledge of what data you have and where it lives before requesting any service, if you need help performing your own backups, contact me and I will send you info. If you need extended guidance, contact me to help you with your backup strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under dire situations, if you contact me in the 4 month period, and you need more time, I may, at my discretion, hold on to the backup image for 2 extra months, totaling 6 months. There is no guarantee that the data you are looking to retrieve, exists in my backups. &lt;strong&gt;For my own specific liability reasons, I cannon hold onto data any longer than the time that was specified and will have to delete it to protect your privacy with in the time periods specified above. If you have any questions about my status as a service provider from a legal perspective, please review my &amp;ldquo;Right to Self-Regulation&amp;rdquo; in my Terms of Service .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please be aware that migrating to and from different technologies can result in problems with 3rd party hardware or software. I am your facilitator in that process, I am not representative for these third party technologies, that are out of my control. If I encounter an issue with any 3rd party technology (Hardware or Software that was not setup by me), I may need to troubleshoot/diagnose the issue, handled under my diagnostic fees, before I can continue the work. In these cases, it&amp;rsquo;s important to make manual backups of all your important data before making a service request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your data is &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; responsibility. Please be sure that the data you want transferred actually exists on the device. If you have any special programs/data outside of written documents, music, videos and pictures, I may ask you to show me where this data is stored before I can proceed with any data transfer service. That being said, I cannot account for data I don&amp;rsquo;t know you have. &lt;strong&gt;Verify for yourself any important data exists on the device before requesting transfer services&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;service-limitations-liability&#34;&gt;Service Limitations &amp;amp; Liability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process of providing services to you the following can occur updating software, or making changes to the way software functions on your device, bugs and errors can be introduced by the way in which software interacts with the operating system. Also, failures in the functioning of hardware could be introduced as a result of my servicing. Some of the resulting failures could be related to, but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Issue Type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible Example Causes (But not limited to)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mishandeling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Acting without the necessary care or skill to correctly operate or configure the equipment under your care.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;- Overclocking, or changing hardware settings that push the operating specifications beyond the tolerances of the hardware (Regardless of any prescribed limits recommended by the originating manufacturer or 3rd parties)  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;- Improper Maintenance: changing or removing settings or compoents&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wear &amp; Tear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Wear and tear is damage that naturally and inevitably occurs during the normal life cycle of a device. It is a form of depreciation, which is assumed to occur even when an item is used competently and with care and proper maintenance.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;- Laptop plastic casing can become brittle over time and get worse during handling  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;- Eletronic compoents stop working or work incorrectly due to solder oxidation or circuit board aging&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design Flaw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A design defect refers to a flaw inherent in a hardware itself. The way it was designed or manufactured could cause the device to not perform or operate as expected, or cause it to fail in some way sooner than a the normal life expectancy of the product.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;- Laptops compoents have connecting cables that are folded in such a way that eventaully cause wear in the wiring&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A flaw in a computer program that prevents a device from functioning properly, or opens the program to unauthorized manipulation&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;- Communication between a computer and a printer stops working because a bug was introduced into a recently or currently installed driver.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glitch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A glitch is a temporary malfunction or irregularity in a computer system, electronic device, or software. It often occurs unexpectedly and can cause unexpected behavior or minor errors within the system. Glitches may resolve spontaneously or require intervention to fix the issue.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;- A computer screen can flicker and return to normal, indicative of a failing compoent&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incompatibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Software incompatibility is a characteristic of software components or systems which cannot operate satisfactorily together. They may be components or systems which are intended to operate cooperatively or independently. Software compatibility is a characteristic of software components or systems which can operate satisfactorily together. It is possible that some software components or systems may be compatible in one environment and incompatible in another.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;- A program designed for Windows XP no longer works with a current or more recent version of Windows  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;- A financial application like Quickbooks stops talking to a PDF form Plug-in due to one of the vendors stopping their support of said product&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If any of the above situations arise, additional costs outside the quoted or estimated fees might be required. My liability and responsibility stops at my &lt;a href=&#34;#service-guarantee&#34;&gt;service guarantee&lt;/a&gt;. If I fail to complete a specific piece of work, or I misconfigure/mishandle your device I will take responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Due to a small percentage of bad experiences with certain hardware configurations, like failing electronics, I reserve the right to recommend a replacement part instead of a repair, if a replacement part exists. Otherwise, Ill recommend a full replacement of the product. This situation usually arises with computer hardware that has reached it&amp;rsquo;s end of life, but other conditions may cause these issues. If this situation arises for you, and you want your issue resolved in a good way, please be prepared to cover the costs for a replacement device and my time for migrating your data. The costs usually run around $1,000, or more depending on what requirements you have.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;software-licensing&#34;&gt;Software Licensing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of installing software, or licenses for software, in order to provide you the service you requested, I may need certain information (like login details, or software packages). I may also need to spend billable time gathering information to install any software, or licenses for which you do not have the correct information on hand. &lt;strong&gt;To obtain this information on you behalf, you might agree to allow me to access to online accounts that contain this information and to make this process as seamless as possible, also I may ask you to provide your email credentials so that I can access your email account to perform password resets on accounts that have information that I require to continue the servicing. I take privacy very seriously, and I will only use what information I find in your email account to complete these services. Please see &lt;a href=&#34;#privacy-statement-communication&#34;&gt;my privacy section&lt;/a&gt; of this document for more information.&lt;/strong&gt; Price quotes and estimates are determined by the available information I have at hand at the time of intake. Please be aware that that prices quoted, or estimated are subject to change if new information is required or becomes available during the servicing. If you refuse to continue servicing after a price change, you agree to pay any and all outstanding quoted or estimated charges, regardless of the state of the device, or the status/progress of the work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In certain cases, when upgrading, or replacing computer hardware; or moving a software license to another computer hardware configuration, there are no absolute hard and fast rules regarding what will actually happen when a certain software product key/license is applied to different set of hardware from the original configuration the license was applied to. If the software product you depend on, Like the Windows Operating System, is not able to be re-activated after the hardware replacement, upgrade, or software license move, you may be obligated by the licensing of the product to purchase a new license. This may incur an additional expense outside of any quotes, estimates or fees that I specify in my communications to you about costs. Any licensing challenges that come up do not change the fees owed to me for the parts I order on your behalf, or the fees related to the service I provide to you. It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t obligate me to provide you any free of charge services due to this issue.  If you have questions about this limitation, please let me know before agreeing to any fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;equipment-left-behind&#34;&gt;Equipment Left Behind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very proactive in keeping you in the loop on the status of your device. If for some reason I do not hear back from you on a communication for a period of 120 days, depending on my time constraints, I am assuming you do not want whatever equipment you have left behind, and your equipment will be irrevocably destroyed, or may be sold to cover any costs. I will do my best to secure erase your data to protect your privacy, but I am not liable for any results that occur from any kind of breach to your personal data from devices that are left behind though I excel at protecting your data.
Even though I am not required to, I will make attempts to contact you before 120 days. This may involve all of the following during this 120 day period: a few calls, an email, a text message (If a mobile number is on file), and a post letter(IF I have an address for you, on file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-device-setup&#34;&gt;New Device Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert-container&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you purchase a device from me, bring a new device in for setup or a tune-up, I will remove, replace, or disable features that I deem best for my customers. These fine tuning operations are done to improve customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This might include removing, replacing or disabling (also by your request): security software, preloaded apps that are not part of the required core functionality of the system, or hardware that is causing performance bottlenecks. For example, I might increase the memory size, or the speed of the storage device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At all times the device will be remain functional, but you might have an expectation about the device that I deliberately changed. If you have a required need for a default application, or setting/customization, that would have existed with another device provider, please let me know so that we can talk about that requirement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you request a removal of an application, you will be liable for any ramification of that request. For instance: If you request that a default security package be removed due to the fact that you prefer to install your own and you forget to perform that operation, and that inaction causes some kind of harm to you, another party, or to any property; You, and you alone are responsible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to Windows 10/11 data collection practices and the impact it has on customer privacy, when I install, reinstall, or tune-up Windows 10/11 on any Windows device that enters this office, I remove and disable the unnecessary, and in many cases unwanted functions listed below. You can opt to install or re-enable the app, or feature in question yourself by launching the Microsoft Store App on your computer, doing a search for the missing App, and then installing it. (Please note that I do not guarantee any performance improvements on any of these adjustments.):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I disable all Telemetry and Data Collection services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I uninstall all Microsoft Windows 10/11 apps, except the basic, or useful ones that would prevent the normal operation of the device: Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Store, Calculator, Sticky Notes, Windows.photos, Soundrecorder, MSpaint, Screensketch, Cortana.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I may Install new default applications to make use of: Photos(Fast Stone Image Viewer), Internet Browsing(Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome), Email(Mozilla Thunderbird) Videos(VLC), and Media Creation(Burn Aware).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I uninstall and disable the Onedrive configuration by default. This prevents personal data from being sent to Microsoft cloud services without the customers knowledge. I do this mainly to avoid customer confusion about where personal/business data lives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless you make a request, or I determine in our communication leading up to the service, I do not configure the Windows user account to be attached to a Microsoft account. This decision is to avoid customer confusion about how online services get used without the user&amp;rsquo;s knowledge on the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I associate a web browser of your choice to minimize having to use the user hostile Edge browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that the way in which Microsoft implements changes to the OS and their attempts to obfuscate customer choice is hostile to the user. These changes may be reverted by a future Microsoft update so I am unable to guarantee any specific configurations will continue to operate once the device leaves my office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this to give my customers a good experience with their device by decluttering the operation of the Windows operating system and protecting customer privacy. This has the potential to improve the performance and user experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;storage-encryption-decryption&#34;&gt;Storage Encryption/Decryption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases, storage device encryption prevents me from providing the services you request. For instance, if your system fails to boot, I will need to decrypt your storage device. There are other possible reasons for me to decrypt your file system, especially if I need to perform a bare metal backup of your system to protect the data contents in case of some kind of failure. For more information about that, see my &amp;ldquo;Protecting Your Data&amp;rdquo; section. If your storage device has been encrypted by the default Windows installation, I will decrypt it using the credentials you supplied to me to provide the service. If you require your storage device to be encrypted, you can re-enable that encryption after the service is complete. Having a device with unencrypted storage may open your data up to theft, protecting your data is your responsibility. If you have questions about this topic or need help please, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#contact&#34;&gt;Contact me&lt;/a&gt; before requesting service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;privacy-statement-communication&#34;&gt;Privacy Statement - Communication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the servicing of your device, by your request, I may have to access certain areas of your file system, or online accounts, that might contain private information. I will not knowingly take any action that involves breaching the privacy to your digital information unless I receive a lawful court order compelling me give possession of your data to an individual acting in a position of law enforcement. I make every effort within my ability to secure any private/personal communications/data from any locations that I service devices at. There is a possibility that my communications (that might contain information about you, or a 3rd party) could be intercepted by an online or at-location attacker without my knowledge. If my physical location or my internal network is breached, your private information could be compromised. In cases, like these, beyond my control, I am not liable nor responsible for any results that occur due to the above situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;privacy-statement-data&#34;&gt;Privacy Statement - Data&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you bring your device to me for servicing, I make an encrypted safety backup of your device&amp;rsquo;s system data. This includes the system hard drive, or storage device, and/or any other device that is required for the system to function normally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do this in case a issue occurs during, or after the service is complete, that would prevent you from accessing your device, or data. I keep this backup in encrypted form for around 4 months. This means that if my equipment were ever to become lost, or a theft occurred, the encryption method, 256 AES, serves as a significant deterrent against accessing your data stored in my backup. This safety backup is not a guarantee that I can provide to you a copy of your data, at your request, in the event you experience a loss, after the return your device. If you did not purchase a data-backup, and if I still have a backup of your data on hand, depending on my storage free space requirements at the time, I can provide you with a copy of your data under a data restore service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To provide to you a service such as, but not limited to, a data transfer service, I also may need to access certain areas of your device&amp;rsquo;s file system or online accounts that could contain private information. I have strict principles against using information outside the services I provide to you, and I have processes in place to protect your private information from falling into the wrong hands. Some of those processes are communicated through this document, but if you have specific concerns, please reach out to me. That being said, I may share your personal/private information if it&amp;rsquo;s to provide to you a specific service that I subcontract to another provider, such as, but not limited to, a data recovery service provider (By your request to have data recovered), or to comply with a lawful order from a common law court. In the case where I pass information to a 3rd party provider, they have their own privacy policies that your data, or information would fall under once the device/information is in their possession. If you have specific questions, or concerns, that are outside of these described scopes, please contact me to get clarification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;responsibility&#34;&gt;Responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a professional computer technician, I&amp;rsquo;m responsible for addressing operational related issues with technology at the time of servicing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preexisting unrelated/related software or hardware problems can be revealed at any time during the servicing. Occasionally these problems can be missed during a servicing. These issues can cause pervasive and reoccurring issues that may require follow-up and secondary servicing/intervention to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When these rare situations arise, If I spot the issue during my servicing I will reach out to you to let you know of a problem. When this happens, I may need to perform a diagnostic to resolve the issue, I will bill you for my diagnostic time under these circumstances, if you have any questions about these follow up fees, please contact me. Also If the problem is missed during servicing I can address these issues at a later date at my &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#service-repair-rates-turnaround&#34;&gt;regular rates&lt;/a&gt;. Reoccurring issues that are attributed to the same conditions that caused the original issue, can be handled under a reduced fee (at my discretion). If the issue is closely related to the original issue from a previous servicing, I may reduce the rate in half for the second visit. Also In some rare cases, if there is a third or forth visit, I may reduce my rate to 75% of what I originally charged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I intuit that an issue is going to be systemic during a servicing, I reserve the right to offer a recommendation for a solution, on in lieu of a resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;self-regulation&#34;&gt;Self-Regulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All my rights as a service providing individual are reserved&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I provide you a service, or if an arrangement that benefits both you and I is agreed upon, or in the works, I reserve the right not to subject myself to background checks, licenses to provide services, be employed by another, be classified into a status or standing that interferes with my rights, or any process that subjects me to any authority other than my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that this right is not a claim of lawlessness. I am responsible for my conduct in my personal and professional life. If there is a claim of wrong doing by an individual, I will answer that claim and take responsibility for any action I take that harms another living being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reserve the right to: refuse to accept you as a new customer, halt work in progress, if there is a breach in my terms of service by you, your employees, or any other person that operates on your behalf. Such possibilities for me to refuse or halt work are: using abusive or dismissive language, in writing, or in person. Making a habit of being late, or not showing up for appointments. Making a habit of failing to communicate when I require a response to continue to provide you service. Making a habit of not paying me on time or when I require it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;manufacturer-warranty-voiding&#34;&gt;Manufacturer Warranty Voiding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some manufacturers have Warranties that become voided if repairs are performed by a 3rd party. Be sure you are not voiding your warranty by having me work on your device. I am not liable nor responsible for any out-of warranty fees, or any results that occur due to this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;service-guarantee&#34;&gt;Service Guarantee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of my services are guaranteed to be free from errors in execution. I will resolve any issue that crops up due to my error free of charge.  Any device purchased from me that has parts containing a replacement guarantee from the manufacturer, also carries my 1 year service replacement warranty from the date of service. Unless I am unable to deliver the service, or item in question, all fees for provided services and any related items are final and non-refundable. Although I make every effort to ensure my customers are happy with the services I provide, shipment delays of any kind, dissatisfaction of a product or service does not warrant an exception from payment. I provide no guarantees on actual performance of hardware or software even though I make every effort to provide accurate projections. I also provide no guarantee on any interactions between 3rd party services and any solutions I provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert-container&#34;&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Software support is usually outside of the scope of my Service Guarantee&lt;/h4&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you request software or a service to be setup, maintained, or repaired on your device/s, and you require support during or after my servicing, I may be required to interact with the software or service provider to resolve the issue. In addition, if a change was made post-service, that caused the issue, I might be required to undue or resolve those changes. In both cases, you may incur additional charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 id=&#34;turn-around-time&#34;&gt;Turn-Around Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I operate on a first come, first serve basis. Unless you want a priory service. If you need a faster turn-around, see my priority &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#service-repair-rates-turnaround&#34;&gt;rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my regular service schedule, I prioritize servicings based on the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priority Customers (paid priority service 1-2 day turn-around)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st Class Customers (3-7 day turn around, regular visits)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd class customers (1 week+).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I am waiting on parts to be shipped, I put the servicing for that device on hold and handle the next device in line based on the prioritization above. I also prioritize customers that have already paid, or are regularly paying customers, over those that have an outstanding payments, or overdue payments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the evaluation or in-take period, I will do my best to communicate to you the length of time a service might require. With certain technical problems, the length of time to service your device can range from a couple hours, days, or even weeks depending on the issue, and the time may change depending on what crops up during the servicing. If you cannot be without your device for the length of time specified above, purchase a backup device, or ask me about acquiring a temporary replacement loaner device. If my loaner stock is available, I can lend you a device until the work is complete. If you require access to your personal, or business data, that data will need to be transferred to the loaner device. Also applications might need to be installed to make use of that data. Talk to me about data/application setup fees if this is a requirement for you.  Depending on the amount of data to be transferred, or applications to be installed, turn-around times can range between a few hours to a few days depending on the size of the data, the complexity of the transfer, or my current time constraints. For faster service, check out my &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#service-repair-rates-turnaround&#34;&gt;priority service pricing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;orders-and-shipping&#34;&gt;Orders and Shipping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to order hardware from online suppliers, instead of relying on brick and mortar vendors for the reasons specified in my &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-laptop-buyers-guide/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Laptop Buyers Guide&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; article. As I prefer to use high quality parts, in most cases, I will not depend on purchasing products from local distributors. When purchasing products from online vendors, shipping times can sometimes be hit or miss. Any times I communicate about shipping are estimates and are subject to change depending on courier conditions, or the information I have at my disposal at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Items that get lost in shipping are handled under the courier&amp;rsquo;s claim handling system. Only after completing the claim process, and waiting for that process to complete, will you be compensated for lost items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipments that don&amp;rsquo;t arrive on time, are wrong items, or are late requires resolution with the online vendor. In these cases I have to submit a case, or ship the wrong item back and wait for the process to be complete for shipments to be redelivered. This process can take weeks, or in rare cases, months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not prepared to wait for packages to be delivered, which under normal circumstances can take 3-7 business days, and in rare cases, such as items shipped from out of the country, up to a month, so I can perform my services, please reach out to me to discuss alternatives. I am not liable, nor responsible for delay shipments. Should you wish to cancel any services related to delayed, or items lost in shipping, my service fees are not refundable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When there is a need to order parts for the servicing of your device, I may mark up the item by 10% to cover price changes related to post COVID market volatility. I&amp;rsquo;ll use some of that fee to cover handling or the work involved in finding a replacement. I may return the a portion of that fee as a credit on your bill, or refund you if there isn&amp;rsquo;t a service to apply it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-i-provide-service-to&#34;&gt;Who I provide service to&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I provide technical service solely to individuals. If you own a business, or you work for a business all service related dealings will be handled by you and I. If you want someone else to engage with me on a service in question on your behalf, please provide your consent in writing to allow that someone to speak for you, and act on your behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you request a service from me, recurring or otherwise, it is by contract. Please note that any arrangement is only between you and I. As such, if I provide a service to you that results in an exchange of property (My services for any payment method you use to compensate me) that exchange does not include any 3rd party.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Looking back at my transition from Windows to Linux in an anti-customer age</title>
      <link>http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-looking-back-windows-to-linux/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Aug 2025 12:37:05 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-looking-back-windows-to-linux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a computer professional that helps the public with technology. I have been troubleshooting computer problems for over 25 years. To find out more about me, visit my &lt;a href=&#34;https://scottRlarson.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;home page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August of 2023, I &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-transition-windows-to-linux/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about my switch to Linux as a Windows-centric professional. I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled in Linux as a daily driver in the past, but it has always ended in some form of defeat. Eventually returning to my abuser, Windows. It was a hard road leaving it behind, but determination can work wonders when flying the freedom skies. Starting with the release of Windows 11, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s shady tactics increased to the point where it&amp;rsquo;s no longer a viable option for an operating system, unless you don&amp;rsquo;t mind that your desktop is used as an advertising platform, or being forced to allow Copilot, Recall and OneDrive abuse the relationship to your data. Much of the commercial software industry invested into proprietary applications have descended into chaos in the last five years. Recently an intense feeding frenzy for control over the user experience rose to an all time high. Subscriptions replacing purchases of software products is the biggest example of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my previous article I was worried that I might give up, and switch back. Did I make it this time? Yes! Yes, I did. It&amp;rsquo;s been two years now. I finally weaned myself off of Big Daddy. Â I do everything in Linux now. Obviously, there are still some pain points that I have a hard time with, but isn&amp;rsquo;t that true with any operating system?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a survivor of that dependency, I sometimes feel that I am making the problem worse by installing and supporting Windows 11 for my customers. A new violation of trust is always just around the corner, even though I work very hard to remove or circumvent these hostile features. Â OneDrive even silently reinstalled itself and moved one customer&amp;rsquo;s data to the cloud, all without consent. One day their data was on the local drive and the next it became online-only files that had to be downloaded from Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s servers. I see an avalanche of justifications from people still stuck on Windows. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s just a bug&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;These things will get ironed out in time&amp;rdquo; But the truth is that the freedom to choose is slowly being eroded. When we live in a consumer society where anti-trust seems to mean nothing, what does one do? Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stopkillinggames.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;StopKillingGames&lt;/a&gt; movement is of a similar line. Someone decided enough is enough and went toe to toe with what I consider corporate culture run amok in the AAA game industry. And then we have our friends in Europe that passed the Digital Markets Act, challenging Apple&amp;rsquo;s stranglehold on the App Store. I think Europe is positioning itself as the last bastion of hope for customer rights worldwide. With digital commerce, when rights are upheld in one country, other countries can receive the downstream effects. We are also starting to see &lt;a href=&#34;https://pirg.org/campaigns/right-to-repair/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RightToRepair&lt;/a&gt; challenges with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EWAIlX5d1Y&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;3rd party equipment providers that attempt to prevent 1st party servicing using IP arguments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what have I learned through all this? I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that making myself free requires effort. The technical challenges of Linux are a bit steeper, but not impossible. Ownership and control over products I purchased are more important than I realized. When I lose control over something I purchased, it disrupts my freedom, and this disruption affects the relationship with myself and the world. It happens slowly. First, I brush off violations to my freedom as an annoyance that needs to be routed around. Then, when more violations occur, I start to get angry that I have to waste more of my time fixing something that I didn&amp;rsquo;t break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that this anger is directed at myself. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a form of resentment towards myself for sacrificing something important for a minor inconvenience thatâs designed to become a major roadblock by each iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is the major sticking point. I cannot ignore that slow boil any longer. It&amp;rsquo;s time to see these dark patterns for what they are: a slow movement towards a feudal system where I will own nothing and be happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This problem is not just happening with software ownership; it&amp;rsquo;s happening everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with this quote from the character Nemik in the Star Wars TV series &amp;ldquo;Andor&amp;rdquo;:Â &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember this, Freedom is a pure idea. It occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that theyâve already enlisted in the cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And remember this: the Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empiresâs authority and then there will be one too many. One single thing will break the siege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember this: Try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux is a real alternative to Windows now and it&amp;rsquo;s about time as more and more companies move to anti-competitive practices, harming public trust and individual choice. In the long run, the products we use should be in our control and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is enabling OneDrive by default which will sync your data to the cloud, put your data in offline mode and this setup can prevent you from accessing your data if something happens with the cloud provider. Its strongly advised not to setup a new PC yourself but to have a professional set it up without this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/updates/windows11-oobe-backup-onedrive-forced-setup/one-drive-prompt-start-backup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of prompt that may trick you into setting up one drive&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft might try to trick you into setting up one drive again with a prompt like this. If you click start, it will move your files to a OneDrive Folder on your computer and start syncing your data without your consent. If you dont want your file location changed or your data moved into the cloud, do not act on this prompt. There are also reports of Microsoft silently installing OneDrive for Office customers who have installed Office365 and performing this setup without user interaction or consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find that your PC has been setup with OneDrive, your data has been moved to the cloud and want your data returned to your computer, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#contact&#34;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; me to set up an appointment for a service to restore your data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Antimalware Security Is Now Bloatware</title>
      <link>http://scottrlarson.com/updates/update-antimalware-security-bloatware/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:19:12 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://scottrlarson.com/updates/update-antimalware-security-bloatware/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of installing a third-party security product is to protect the computer from unwanted and unnecessary software that can confuse and complicate the customer experience. Since 2023, or even before, consumer security products have undergone changes. From products that protect you from malicious software and unwanted access, to products that attempt to sell you add-ons that you don&amp;rsquo;t need, like VPN services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is for these reasons that I no longer recommend any 3rd party security products. The best way to protect yourself from threats on your computer and online is to stick with Windows&amp;rsquo; built-in product &amp;ldquo;Windows Defender&amp;rdquo; and go with a browser like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.firefox.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; that has the Ublock Origin add-on. Ublock protects the browser from malicious Ad networks, and Windows Defender does a pretty good job of protecting you from email threats and files that find their way to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay away from the 3rd party vendors like McAfee and Norton, and all the other 3rd party providers. I have yet to encounter a security provider that doesn&amp;rsquo;t include some kind of notification system that tries to get you to purchase and install add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are PC Hardware Companies Slowly Driving Technology into Restricted Closed Ecosystems?</title>
      <link>http://scottrlarson.com/updates/update-closed-technology-ecosystems-storage-configuration-lockdown/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I am a Computer Hardware professional. I started working with computer technology in the early eighties. I have seen the evolution of technology starting with closed platforms like the game console era and then the move toward open platforms like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scottrlarson.com/memorials/memorial-my-home-computer-reflections-part-1/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Home Computer Golden Age&lt;/a&gt;. In the last 5 or 10 years, I have witnessed technology changes that are slowly moving away from open hardware designs towards hardware that is locked down and can&amp;rsquo;t be modified by the user.  For more articles on this subject, see my  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scottrlarson.com/categories/deceptivetechnology/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DeceptiveTechnology&lt;/a&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-dell-limiting-access-to-drivers-and-designing-bios-to-minimize-os-changes&#34;&gt;Is Dell limiting access to drivers and designing BIOS to minimize OS changes?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, I have noticed a trend where Dell does not provide RST storage drivers for NVME SSDs (the software that allows a user to cleanly install an operating system from media) on Laptops and Desktops. Normally, you can just go into the BIOS, switch from NVME Raid to ACHI, and be done with itâor can you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a Dell Inspiron 16 Plus 7640 Laptop with a BIOS that does not have an option to change to an AHCI storage configuration. Without the RST storage driver not being made available on Dell&amp;rsquo;s website, and no ability to switch to ACHI, you cannot reinstall Windows in a clean state from a installation disk because the install requires that the RST driver be manually loaded befoe it can see the storage device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/oem-rst-driver-debacle-or-intentional/dell-inspiron-16-plus-bios-storage-configuration-missing-ahci-mode.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Dell Inspiron 16plus bios storage configuration missing AHCI mode&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, you would see this screen that allows you to switch storage modes
&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/oem-rst-driver-debacle-or-intentional/dell-inspiron-3030-bios-storage-configuration.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Dell Inspiron 3030 bios storage configuration AHCI mode&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried the key combinations to enable advanced BIOS configuration that worked on previous models, but no dice. Is it a coincidence that Dell has not been releasing the RST storage drivers for most of these models in the last couple of years, and is now deciding that the BIOS storage configuration should not be changable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you check Dell&amp;rsquo;s website for drivers, you probably will not see RST drivers for many models listed. I checked the driver listing for my model and so far I don&amp;rsquo;t see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/oem-rst-driver-debacle-or-intentional/dell.com-support-storage-driver-listings-lack-RST.resized.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Dell.com Support Storage Driver Listings Lack RST&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a different model with no RST listing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/oem-rst-driver-debacle-or-intentional/dell.com-support-storage-driver-listings-lack-RST-different-model.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Dell.com Support Storage Driver Listings Lack RST Differnt Model&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try to find drivers online, based on the hardware id&amp;rsquo;s, especially from Intel&amp;rsquo;s website, but they don&amp;rsquo;t always work for your particular model. I even tried to extract the drivers from the OS but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to find a .inf configuration profile to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These changes effectively prevents a user from cleanly reinstalling the operating system from media. The only option, that I can see, is to install from the service partition on the device, or from Dell&amp;rsquo;s BIOS re-installation technology, which contains bloatware, targeted advertising, and data collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m open to being wrong, please let me know if I am missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short of evidence to the contrary. I believe this is one small part of a bigger and long-term planned effort within the PC hardware and software industries to control the user experience for consumer hardware. Apple is also moving in this direction with the MacOS by limiting non-approved software from being installed. Yes, you can work around it, but it&amp;rsquo;s getting harder and harder to do so with every iteration of the Operating System.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are slowly being boiled to the point of no return. We need some kind of consortium for users to represent our interests otherwise in 10 or 20 years we will have very limited choice when it comes to computer technology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are Hardware Manufacturers Trying to Lock Down Consumer Hardware?</title>
      <link>http://scottrlarson.com/updates/update-hardware-manufactures-consumer-hardware-lockdown/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:22:25 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://scottrlarson.com/updates/update-hardware-manufactures-consumer-hardware-lockdown/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is a byproduct of cost savings decisions by replicating enterprise-grade hardware manufacturing design principles and using them to design consumer-grade technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scottrlarson.com/img/updates/TotalitarianismTechnology/Inspiron16Plus7640.webp&#34; alt=&#34;Dell Inspiron 16 Plus Image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I received a Dell Inspiron 16 Plus 7640 that has options removed.  The storage section had no setting to change to a non-raid option. Because OEMs install bloatware on their systems, I choose to install the OS clean, or in most cases, I need to clone a system from dissimilar hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scottrlarson.com/img/updates/TotalitarianismTechnology/Dell-Inspiron16Plus-BIOS-Storage.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dell Inspiron 16 Plus BIOS Storage Image&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default Windows Install won&amp;rsquo;t see the storage device when you try to reinstall a clean copy of Windows from media if you can&amp;rsquo;t switch the storage to &amp;ldquo;non-raid&amp;rdquo; without loading the driver manually. So I thought, ok I&amp;rsquo;ll download the driver from Dell&amp;rsquo;s support website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://scottrlarson.com/img/updates/TotalitarianismTechnology/Dell-Inspiron16Plus-Support-Website-RST-Drivers-Missing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dell Inspiron 16 Plus Support Website RST Drivers Missing Image&#34; /&gt;
But lo and behold, they don&amp;rsquo;t make it available. By the way, this is not just an isolated occurrence, in the last few years I have seen other Dell models driver listings without the RST driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could pull the drivers from the factory OS, but, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, that shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be required and its time consuming for me to have to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have experienced this, let me know in the Hacker News comments. I believe that hardware manufacturers are slowly moving towards a model where you can&amp;rsquo;t customize the hardware you buy. I strongly encourage people not to purchase products and return products that don&amp;rsquo;t have the needed BIOS options and the proper drivers available for their hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about getting a ThinkBook 16 Gen 7 (16â³ Intel) Laptop as a replacement. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that Lenovo Makes RST drives available or the BIOS options are as such I can customize the OS the way I want, if you know of a better model that is designed and released without these anti-competitive changes, let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
