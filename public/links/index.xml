      <description>How to Delete Your Data Securely on macOS  This is a good guide that explains how to securely delete data from a Mac, but it also references a PC. These instructions might be beyond the capabilities for the average computer user, but it&amp;rsquo;s still good to know what is involved in securely deleting data.
When you get rid of an old computer that has data on it, that has not been securely deleted, that data can be mined by people that have an interest in stealing your assets, or impersonating you to hide criminal behavior.</description>
