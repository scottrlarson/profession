## Backup System Management Service Information

{{% accordion-list title="Backup System Management Case Study" id="disaster-rec-info"  %}}
### Why would I want Disaster Recovery Backup System Management?
- One of my customers was surprised that the service Carbonite was not backing up a special accounting program data. Due to the way in which the application accessed the proprietary data, the application prevented Carbonite from accessing and backing it up. The customer had to rebuild that particular data set from scratch.
- When you run a business and have special software you rely on, I can sit down with you, and find out what data is most important to secure. I provide solutions that aim to prevent catastrophic loss of critical data. In monitoring backup, I can determine what is being backed up. With my **Upkeep System Management Service** I monitoring the life of the hardware which allows me to alert you of a pending failure, or trigger a backup before a loss occurs. Even if you have simple needs, don't let the upgrade of your current system slip though the cracks of a upgrade.

- If you purchase the **Total Security, Upkeep, and Backup System Management Service** package, it covers the installation and upkeep of each service. I remotely manage and customize the service's settings to help prevent most problems from causing system downtime or loss of data. If a problem is identified during my normal monitoring, I will contact you and let you know a normal servicing needs to happen, and we can talk about [fees](/#rates) or I can send you a quote of service. 
- **Upkeep System Management** is a service that helps prevent downtime by identifying potential problems to your hardware and software before they cause catastrophes.
- **Backup System Management** is a service that helps prevent backup failures from happening and with the upkeep monitoring portion may enable me to trigger a backup before a catastrophe in many cases.

### Definitions

- **S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) **is a monitoring system included in computer hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and eMMC drives. Its primary function is to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability with the intent of anticipating imminent hardware failures. When remotely monitoring S.M.A.R.T. It's possible to detect imminent storage drive failures, so preventative action can be taken to prevent data loss, the failing drive can be replaced and data integrity maintained. 

- **Backup redundancy** protects your data from data loss. In the instance of a local backup if you system is lost or taken a cloud backup would protect you against theft or loss.


- As of 2020 I use **Macrium Reflect as a Backup** and Disaster recovery solution. It is a reliable and well a tested product for making regular backups and restores of both system and personal data. Macrium Software was founded in 2006 when CEO and Founder Nick Sills experienced a personal data disaster and in the process discovered existing backup tools were not as good as he expected. Wanting a software solution that was practical and easy to use, Nick and his team developed Macrium Reflect to create a safe and secure disk image with ultra-fast recovery times should disaster strike.

- This Management service **does not cover costs of installation or replacement hardware**, if any.
