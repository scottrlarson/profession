## Data Recovery
{{% alert title="STOP!" url="" %}}
If you experienced a loss on a device you are currently using, unless you have a backup of your lost/damaged data that you want to recover,  stop using your device immediately after you notice the loss, or failure, as further use could prevent a full recovery.
{{< /alert >}}

The chances of recovery depend on some factors: If you own a Laptop or Desktop with either a Hard Disk Drive or Solid State Storage device. The state of the damage/loss on the device, or if your data was deleted, or wiped. In some cases, you might have a backup of your damaged or lost data and if so, in many cases data can be recovered from this backup. If you do not have a backup of your data, and you have no choice but to attempt a recovery, I will need to perform an analysis on your device, to confirm that the lost/damaged data can be recovered.

- Data Recovery turn-Around times and costs can vary. Turn-around times can take between 1 day to 3 weeks depending on my time constraints, and the state of your device. If physical damage exists on your device, the particular damage may significantly slow your device's recovery time. Check below for price ranges.
- The recovery fee portion covers a full recovery of the data you need.



###  Supported Storage Devices

- Hard Disk Drives
- Solid State Drives
- Flash Memory Drives
- Floppy/Tape Media
- Optical Media (CD/R DVD/R)


### Analysis/Handling
{{% alert title="**No Refunds on Initial Analysis/Handling Fee**" url="" %}} The service below includes a damage report and a quote to recover the data. Turn-around time from analysis to recovery can range between 1-3 days or 1 to 3 weeks depending on the extent of the damage/loss. In rare cases, due to the nature of select cases of systemic damage, certain recovery cases may take 1-3 months for research, testing, and full recovery.  {{< /alert >}}

Under my Analysis/Handling fee, I will determine which category your data loss issue falls under in the following types of recovery. Please note for data recovery there is no charge (Except for the Analysis/Handling Fee) until the data you want is recovered.

### 2. Advanced Recovery (Minimal Hardware Damage)

{{% service-range item-min="$800" item-max="$4000" %}}
Data recovery rates for a partially functioning device that powers up correctly but does not detect via the hardware interface, or does detect but is performing badly, or not reading correctly.

### 3. Catastrophic Recovery (Critical Hardware Damage)
{{% service-range item-min="$1300" item-max="$5000" %}}
Data recovery rates for a non-functioning device. The device does not detect and/or does not power on. Or the device does power on but the data can not be read of the media in any meaningful way necessitating a mechanical failure recovery.

## Password/System Recovery

If you are unable to access your device or data, in many cases I can gain access to the data or equipment. 

For me to perform this service, you must own the equipment, or have power of attorney to act on the owner's behalf. I will need documentation confirming that you purchased the equipment, or a document stating that you have authority to act on behalf of the owner to allow me to service the equipment.
