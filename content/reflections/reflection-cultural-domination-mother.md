I am involved in doing interpersonal work with the [Mankind Project](https://mankindproject.org/) and one of the topics that came up for me this week is my behavior around anger and irritation towards others when I want to push people away. I am discovering that aspects of my behavior around my mother (The Feminine) is a result of what I have learned from my Father (The Masculine). The way in which my parents related to each other contains a male dominating aspect to it. 

One of my Mankind Project brothers suggested I do some writing around this topic. I decided to turn this into a writing via voice dictation on the path of a mini-journey.

For background information on the topic of what I call "Cultural Domination" check out the Wikipedia [article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_imperialism) on "Cultural Imperialism"

I took the higher plane at the fork in the road. The choice between hatred or love for me is a lower or higher decision. When I choose the higher path, I always feel better even though the journey is more difficult. The path becomes easer though each time I take it.

I realize how strenuous this journey can be every time I choose the higher path of doing right for myself and others. I honor my courage and my willingness to not give up.

Sometimes during a rigorous journey, there is a sharp turn in the path. Life is full of ups and downs, where I get turned around. Its faith in the all-good that life brings to me exactly what I need to learn to be a better human being.

I'm finding that this journey is understanding where my blind spots in life are. Many of these blind spots have to do with unfamiliar terrain. I become afraid and often turn away from walking into the unknown.

I reached the highest place I could on this path. As I look out into the horizon, I'm reminded that all journeys take work, but once the work is done, I can enjoy it.

![Shadows](/img/reflections/cultural-domination-1/shadows.jpg)

I'm reminded that my shadows (Unconscious Feelings and Thoughts) follow me, but if I can keep them in the foreground of my life I can see where I'm being driven to act in ways that do not serve the best interests of humanity.

![Roots](/img/reflections/cultural-domination-1/roots.jpg)

My life is like the roots of this tree. Sometimes the roots of my life are visible or protrude out to show me where I have been, and where I want to go.

All in all this journey is about being kind to myself and seeing where I attempt to dominate others to make myself feel comfortable in unfamiliar territory. Then I can stop myself and let the darkness hit me and remain unaltered.
