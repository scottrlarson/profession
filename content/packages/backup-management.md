I provide monitor and maintenance service on the reliable operation of your backups.

## Costs
$150.00 Yearly averages out to $12.50 Monthly

## What you get yearly
- Monitoring of Storage Hardware: Get alerted of storage hardware catastrophes before they happen  \*\*\*
- The disaster recovery software and free upgrades. ($40.00 savings on a license per year) \*
- My disaster recovery management and maintenance of Macrium Software and its backup jobs on a monthly basis yearly. \*\*
- 1 Free Recovery in the event of a catastrophic failure of a storage device or data loss. \*\*\*\*


\* Macrium Reflect is a reliable and well a tested product for making regular backups and restores of both system and personal data. Macrium Software was founded in 2006 when CEO and Founder Nick Sills experienced a personal data disaster and in the process discovered existing backup tools were not as good as he expected. Wanting a software solution that was practical and easy to use, Nick and his team developed Macrium Reflect to create a safe and secure disk image with ultra-fast recovery times should disaster strike.

\*\* Monitoring backup jobs on a regular basis minimizes failures or faults going unchecked leading to catastrophic failures.

\*\*\* S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology; often written as SMART) is a monitoring system included in computer hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs)[1], and eMMC drives. Its primary function is to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability with the intent of anticipating imminent hardware failures. When S.M.A.R.T. data indicates a possible imminent drive failure, software running on the host system may notify the user so preventative action can be taken to prevent data loss, and the failing drive can be replaced and data integrity maintained.

\*\*\*\* Does not include the cost of the replacement part or the labor required to install it, if any.
