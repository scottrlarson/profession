Enpass is [cross-platform](/terms/term-cross-platform) Password Manager. Password Mangers help you keep track of your account information. Learn about [why this is important](\publications\publication-why-password-managers.md) and [why I recommend everyone use one](\recommendations\recommendation-password-managers.md).

Enpass relies on 3rd party [cloud services](/terms/term-cloud-service) to sync your information between your devices such as a PC/Mac Desktop, a Tablet or a phone. I choose solutions that are tolerant to change as much as possible.
 
This guide covers the basics of [setting up a Enpass on a new device](), [how to add new information to the app]() and [how to use Enpass to log into your accounts]().
