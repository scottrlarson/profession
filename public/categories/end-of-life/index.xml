&lt;p&gt;Computers should just last forever, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automobiles don&amp;rsquo;t last forever, and neither do computers. Computers are much more likely to break down or cause issues due to wear and tear because they are much more complicated. Just like automobiles, they require regular upkeep and eventually, yes, they need to be upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are 5 reasons why you should upgrade your computer every five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;file-corruption-due-to-wait-times&#34;&gt;File Corruption Due to Wait Times&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lengthy delays opening resource intensive applications like Outlook creates the illusion of slow or no response. Closing an application that is in the process of opening a file for reading, or writing, can cause data loss. Applications can appear to be hanging up, but in actuality, its waiting on underperforming hardware to respond to commands. As applications evolve, the programming code underlining the application is developed to make use of improvements embedded in modern hardware. New applications can run on older hardware, but at a cost of performance. This performance cost can make an application appear to be non-responsive and you can be tricked into thinking your applications are not working any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;increased-productivity&#34;&gt;Increased productivity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we have faster memory, faster storage drives, increased graphics capabilities, and more processing power – With these increased resources the processing of workloads improves dramatically. There is a joke in technical circles that using an outdated computer, as it gets slower and slower, is like being boiled in a pot of water with the temperature slowing being turned up, you don&amp;rsquo;t notice the heat until it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reduced-cost-over-time&#34;&gt;Reduced cost over time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upgrading sounds expensive, but the truth is that older systems have more issues – and consequently more costs. The cost of dealing with a disruption caused by an unstable system, or faulty software can very quickly become an investment nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;better-security&#34;&gt;Better security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because aging systems are not actively updated, they are vulnerable to having information stolen or compromised. Newer technology in many cases can have better security checking. Of course, upgrading to newer hardware is not a replacement for awareness, read my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scottrlarson.com/tags/security/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; on security to stay up to date on the latest threats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;declining-support&#34;&gt;Declining Support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT professionals can’t productively support technology that has reached it&amp;rsquo;s end of life. It costs more for the technician to service older hardware because of the time it takes to boot and interact with software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a professional that has a PC that is over five years old, or you are an average computer user that has a computer over seven years old &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#contact&#34;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; me for a quote &amp;amp; recommendation on new hardware. I provide comprehensive and cost saving packages that cover every aspect of the upgrade process.&lt;/p&gt;
