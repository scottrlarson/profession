      <div class="panel-body"><p>I am a computer and information technology professional. I got my start in technology working for small custom computer shops back in late nineties. In early 2000 I moved on to Systems Administration for small networks. I got tired with the corporate world and start providing services to the public of Santa Rosa as a independent IT service man. Today I still provide IT services to the public of Santa Rosa, California and surrounding areas.

    <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body"><p>Along the way of providing technical services to the public, I noticed great suffering happening on a spiritual level between myself and the world. I realized, I could no longer sit by and watch my world be destroyed by inaction. Today I work very hard to bring my world into alignment with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1425166695/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_SDWsEb3Y4R0KV">Cosmic Spiritual Law</a> though my own personal activism. I follow strict cosmic rules that govern behavior centered around cause and effect. Every action has an equal an opposite reaction. This principle is well known to apply in physics, but it also operates in every area of life. Harm creates harm, and goodness creates goodness. There are no exceptions. The biggest problem to understanding this concept is knowing what actions cause harm, and what actions cause good. For me, this is a life journey, lived though the heart, that I take to find resolution. </p>

      <p>Spiritual Activism is the coming together of spirituality and activism. It is not about religion, it is not about any form of dogma, it is activism that comes from the heart, not just the head, activism that is compassionate, positive, kind, fierce and transformative. Being a spiritual activist means taking responsibility for my part in creating the change I want to see in the world. Living in a spirit of positivity, compassion, and love with a balance of independence and self determination. Nothing could be more inspiring and more rewarding than being the change I want to see in the world, within and without.</p></div>
