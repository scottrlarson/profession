      <title>As ye have sown, so shall ye reap</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;As ye have sown, so shall ye reap.&amp;rdquo; To me, this is is one of the greatest lessons ever taught by the Light of the World, but because it does not taste good, it been the least emphasized of all the teachings. When this law becomes so thoroughly instilled into the heart of [every man and woman] that it can never be forgotten, then we may begin to look for peace on earth and good will toward all,for when this comes to pass, each of us will be afraid to harm the other because of penalties to be paid during the next round of life or even for the remaining portion of this one. It is going to have to be done, my traveler; you cannot escape it, no matter where you go! Whether we wish to or not, we can not escape this law or any other law as set forth by the Great Soul of the Universe. You may grow as much or as little as you like; The responsibility rests upon you alone and to your own salvation or peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>True Willpower</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“True willpower consists in overcoming the irritabilities, follies, rash impulses and moral lapses which accompany the daily life of the individual, and which are apt to manifest themselves on every slight provocation; and in developing calmness, self-possession, and dispassionate action in the press and heat of worldly duties, and in the midst of the passionate and unbalanced throng. Anything short of this is not true power, and this can only be developed along the normal pathway of steady growth in executing ever more and more masterfully, unselfishly, and perfectly the daily round of legitimate tasks and pressing obligations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;The Spirit of Contentment&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To be contented does not mean to forgo effort; it means to free effort from anxiety ; it does not mean to be satisfied with [harm] sin ’ and ignorance and folly, but to rest happily in duty done, and work accomplished.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
