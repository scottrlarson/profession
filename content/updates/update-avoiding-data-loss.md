Sometimes I run into situations that fall outside of my efforts to help protect custom data through backup recommendations. Please be aware that backups only work when files are in a saved state, meaning that if you are working on a document and you forget to save it, your changes will **NOT** be backed up. Here are tips that can help you avoid losing your work. Anything can happen when you are working with files: The power might go out, you might accidentally wipe the contents of your work with a keystroke you were not aware of, or you might using the undo/redo feature that might bring you to a point where you cannot recover previous work.

If you are working with data in any application: 

1. Save often, at least hourly, but sometimes you might need to save every 5 or 10 minutes depending on how important it is not to re-work previously created content.
2. Save As, with a different file name each time you save. I often combine number one with this habit. I'll save every 10 minutes, then when I reached a significant point in my progress, I'll select the "Save As" option and specify a new file name. This way, the old file will be saved under the old name, and my new file will have the old changes plus anything new that I add to it.
3. Know where your fields are saved. In fact, get into the habit of loading your documents from explorer/finder. Relying on the quick access locations in an application to open your most recently used documents is great, until you forget the name of the file or the shortcut disappears due to some unexpected glitch.
4. After you are done working on document for the day, or for good, make a copy of that file in another location. Use your computers file explorer/finder to perform copy operations.
5. If you are working on a big project, break your work content into separate files to reduce the changes of the entire document becoming lost. You can always combine these files later.
