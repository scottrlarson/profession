Commodore, instrumental in launching the Home Computer movement forward, focused on low cost alternatives to the high end, high price market that the juggernauts Apple and IBM were involved in at the time. [Commodore's decisions around the development of the Home Computer launched many innovations forward that made the computer entertainment industry what it is today.](https://www.bitmapbooks.com/blogs/news/back-to-basic-understanding-the-dazzling-legacy-of-the-commodore-64). 

‘*We need to build computers for the masses, not the classes*.‘ was Commodore’s founder, Jack Tramiel motto.

The C64 was my first computer, if you were using computers at the time, it was likely your first computer to. Simplicity, low cost, superior graphics, quality sound, good game software and aggressive marketing made the C64 the perfect home computer for enthusiasts like me and many others.

Tinkering communities formed around the C64's simple design and broad software support. It was a bit like the cassette tape area. Enthusiasts like me became fascinated with exploring and tinkering with the C64's capabilities by testing the limits of hardware, writing software that does cool things and sharing it with the community.

But the major selling point of the C64 was the low cost for the individual that wanted to design their own programs and games. Back then, designing software was dominated by large companies that either sold software to big business, or manufactures of coin-operated games.

It put the power to create something cool into the hands of regular people. The C64 inspired a whole slew of independent software designed for people who wanted to share their creations. 

## Commodore Amiga 500

Like the first mission to the moon, the technology behind the Amiga 500 Home Computer changed everything. The A500 had it's beginnings at Atari. An engineer, Jay Miner, had an idea to develop a computer that would revolutionize games and make them much easier to develop. 

Too afraid of losing money, Atari corporate executives of that time (this still happens today in many other fields of computer technology) put little-to-no energy into paradigm shifting innovations. This decline was in the process of causing the console industry to collapse. Game development relied heavily on licensing expensive hardware. Due to the fear of losing these deals, Atari prohibited Jay from perusing this new platform. Jay left Atari, and a previous co-worker helped him revive the idea under a new company. Eventually Commodore bought the platform and the Amiga 500 became hit with computer enthusiasts, but what really made the A500 so popular is the music and video entertainment professions who saw the A500's multimedia features as revolutionary. 

The Amiga platform changed the closed and proprietary paradigm of the time with features like: "[Open Architecture](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/history-of-computers,4518-31.html)" and implementation one of the first [Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface). For the last 20 years, we have been circling back to closed and proprietary designs with laptops and tablets. You can read more about this fall in [Part 5](/memorials/memorial-my-home-computer-gaming-biography-part-5.md) of this article. Its only in the last 5 years that things look like they are starting to change. You can read my article on "[Will one repairable laptop change the world?](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-future-of-repairability/)" To see how Open Architecture is making a comeback.

### Open Architecture
During the early Home Computer revolution, many companies designed hardware around the principles of home game consoles which are very static and proprietary end products. These devices are usually designed to prevent changes or upgrades to the internals. Its my belief that creative monopolies, in any regard, stifle innovation. 

The A500 was one of the first computers with an open architecture platform. It had two expansion slots, one on the side and one on the bottom. All of its integrated circuits (ICs) weren't installed directly onto the motherboard, but were mounted onto bases so they could be easily removed and replaced with enhanced ICs. 

Open Architecture was a first for computer enthusiasts, similar to the concept of modularity, parts could be removed, replaced and upgraded. For me, that was what really made home computers interesting. Expanding the capabilities of a computer allowed me to increase my understanding of how computers work and spurred my continued learning. 

### The Graphical User Interface
The Graphical User Interface changed the way in which a computer is operated. Interfacing with a computer is like an extension of human perception. As humans, we interact with our environment by the senses. Interacting with a computer is like an extension between the body and mind. The more intuitive the tool, the more fluid and imaginative one can be with the tool. Imagination and creativity impacts how the world is perceived. The A500 inspired a whole slew of [creative endeavors](https://www.indiegamewebsite.com/2018/10/19/the-complete-history-of-indie-games/) in more creative fields than I can count. Because of this innovation, everything our modern computers are based on owes its beginnings to this era. 

If we go back to the C64 days, computers received instructions from a Command Line Interface (CLI), I.E typing commands to launch programs and work with everyday tasks. There were some limited GUI interfaces that you could load on top of the CLI, but nothing on the scale that the A500 implemented. The whole OS was grounded in a GUI from start to finish, way before Microsoft's Windows operating system was released. It's difficult to quantify the impact the GUI had on my life. Switching between a lifetime of CLI, to a GUI is like miraculously being able to see after years of being blind. 

I believe that the GUI for computing accelerated adoption of computers.  For many people that might have been put-off by command line, the GUI made using computers more intuitive helping to spawn a golden age of digital art and sound.
