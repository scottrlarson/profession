Please be aware that migrating to and from different technologies can result in problems with 3rd party hardware or software. I am your facilitator in that process, I am not representative for these third party technologies that are out of my control. If I encounter an issue with any 3rd party technology (Hardware or Software that was not setup by me), I may need to troubleshoot/diagnose the issue, handled under my diagnostic fees, before I can continue the work. In these cases its important to make manual backups of all your important data before making a service request. If you have any special programs/data outside of written documents, music, videos and pictures, I will ask you to show me where this data is stored before I can proceed with any data transfer service.
