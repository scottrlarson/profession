A disaster recovery backup solution preserves a local copy of all data: Desktop
Settings, Programs, and personal/business data like (Documents, Pictures
or Music) onto a local, network, or cloud based storage device. If any
of your working device components fail catastrophically, your system
state (all data related to the functioning of your device and your
productivity) can be restored to a previous state (before the disaster)
in full running condition with minimal down time. Depending on the
particular situation, having to rebuild your system state involves a
significant amount of time and money. A disaster recovery solution is
like insurance, it protects you when a disaster strikes.

### Quick tips to help you recover from a disaster

-   Most devices have what's called the "Recovery or Installation
    Media" on the internal hard disk. You will need a copy of that
    recovery or installation media if the storage component of your
    device fails. Usually a tool is installed on your device by the
    manufacturer of that device to make a physical copy of that media.
    To find out how to access that tool do a search on your device or on
    google for your device's manufacturer's name like "dell" or
    "hp" plus the words "recovery" and "media"
-   Make a list specific applications that might need to be reinstalled
    and reconfigured to return to normal business.
-   If you have a current backup now have you tested it to make sure you
    can recover the data you want to preserve?

### Case Example

Recently a customer called me about a computer disaster. The customer
explained that Windows 10 decided to update itself right in the middle
of authoring a critical document. The worst part about this situation
was this customer was completely locked out of the device and had been
waiting hours for the update to complete before the call. Sometimes its
not entirely clear when these updates will complete. Windows updates can
sometimes take all night, or sometimes get completely stuck forcing you
to take drastic measures.

With a disaster recovery solution in place you can protect yourself
from:

-   Downtime by avoiding lengthy repairs to your data or system
    configuration.
-   Costly repairs or recovery of the data on your device when it fails.
-   Malware or Ransomeware infections by being able to restore from a
    previous backup.

### Yearly Management & Maintenance {#yearly-management-maintenance .headingAttributes}

When you purchase this solution from me, I set you up with your own
disaster recovery solution and provide you with management & maintenance
service for 1 year. Having a yearly management & maintenance service
contract frees you from having to maintain the solution yourself when it
stops working or when it needs to be updated.

I have a confession to make. I didn't tell you the whole story about
the customer that had that Windows update failure. I didn't mention
that this customer requested more information from me about this very
solution prior to the disasters. When I sent this customer a quote on my
disaster recovery solution this customer didn't think the solution was
worth the cost. I do my very best to keep costs to a minimum, but do you
really want to find yourself in a situation where you have to pay
someone for a lengthy repair when you can have a secure disaster
recovery solution in place where I provide all the resources you need to
help you recover in the event of catastrophe? I provide the most
comprehensive backup solutions to individuals and small business in
northern California area that are affordable, but make no mistake, just
like an insurance policy staying secure costs, regularly. If you want to
have control over your data you need to have a budget for this area of
your life.

I will devise a plan that meets your expectations and provides you with
a safe recovery environment in the event of damage or loss to you most
important data.

How the disaster recovery process works and what to expect (Additional Material)

### Local Disaster Recovery Service {#local-disaster-recovery-service .center}

A local disaster recovery solution backs up your device by transferring
your system state and all data to a local external storage media
connected to the device on a scheduled basis. The schedule is determined
by the retention policy (A method to set how often backups are being
perform and for how long they are stored before they are cleaned up).
The retention policy and schedule will be set based on your needs that I
will discuss with you before I setup the solution.

Below is a diagram showing how the process works:

Network Disaster Recovery Service

A network disaster recovery solution is very similar to a local disaster
recovery solution except that it backs up your device' data by
transferring your system state and all data to a network attached
storage device (An appliance device containing storage devices connected
to a network). Devices that are connected to your home network will see
the NAS device and transfer backup data to it on a scheduled basis.

Below is a diagram showing how the process works:

#### Network Attached Storage Device Features {#network-attached-storage-device-features .headingAttributes}

The NAS Device includes a cloud storage feature so all of multiple users
can store, access and sync important files in one place minimizing file
duplication across all devices.

#### [Network Speed Limitations]{#network-speed-limitations}

The speed of disaster recovery solution is important. If the backups
take to long to complete this slows down your ability to work and
creates more room for failures in the backup process to happen.
Depending on your current network hardware (Modem and Router) an upgrade
to that hardware may be required to meet the minimum speed requirements
of a backup completing successfully in a reasonable amount of time. In
the case of a network disaster recovery service I need to spend some
additional time performing a network site survey of your home network
environment to make sure it's up to speed with any solution I put into
place. Site surveys typically cost \$250.00 flat rate for a 4 users
network.
