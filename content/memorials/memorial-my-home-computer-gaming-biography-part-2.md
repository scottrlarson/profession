My first experience with computers started in the early 1980's on one of the first home computers, the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A. I was about 12 years old. Relatively expensive, but affordable to many middle class families, Home Computers ranged around a thousand dollars in value.

During the introduction of the first models, my family and I did not have a home computer, but fortunately we had a friend who's mother must have saw the value in kids playing with computers and had the resources to purchase one for her son. The reasons why I will never know as I lost contact with them. "**Tunnels of Doom**" became the hot title at the time. As far as I know, it was the first multi-player turn-based [dungeon crawler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_crawl) released at that time. We started our morning loading in the cassette and pushing the play button so the computer could read our previous save game data from the weekend before. After several hours and a home cooked dinner our game would be loaded. We each took our respective turns exploring a procedurally generated dungeon together, engaging in battles with monsters and restoring fallen comrades. I remember it being the first continuous game experience that would last more than one sitting where I learned to cooperate with other players to complete objectives.

A few years after my experience with the TI994a, my parents notice my enthusiasm for the sciences and that my friends and I would spend a lot of time playing on the TI. I think they saw the home computer as a step up from my childhood dream of getting myself into trouble. 

A quick side note, I had brief introduction into electronics theory and practicalities by my Uncle Jim, who worked as a electrician in WWII, and later became a city electrician. When my parents went away on vacation, they would ship me to Chicago to visit my Uncle. He showed me the basics of the apprentice craft. A few years of my life was spent in his basement, building small electronic devices together. Maybe that's why I jump at the prospect of getting my hands on newly released gadgets today.  

As far as electronics go, the computer was, and is, a different beast. Obviously, the inner workings of a computer operates on the same principles of electric current. But what makes home computers different from electronics is the software programming aspect of it. Programming is like creating a list of instructions for something to happen. At the end of the day, is really all about flipping switches. Flipping a sequence of switches actually, in a way the computer can understand.

Anyways, this enthusiasm got me my first computer, a Commodore 64. I'm skipping the part where my real first computer was a TRS-80. Because, well, if you didn't know, back then, it was considered the [Trash 80](https://dfarq.homeip.net/trash-80-what-it-meant-and-why-it-stuck/) by my compadres, and I don't want to mar my reputation :P. It was as good of a computer as any during that time, but since it was sold by Radio Shack, I think it developed a bad reputation because Radio Shack's electronics were considered subpar.

Anyways, forget I ever said anything about that. In the next part, I bring you, the Commodore 64! An extraordinary achievement for Home Computing in the mid-eighties.
