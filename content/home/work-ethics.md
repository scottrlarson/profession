Imagine that you have your own personal Computer Troubleshooter that has your back throughout the day, who has a wide range of expertise, and communicates technical subjects in a simple to understand manner? That also cares about your needs like his own, and keeps excellent records of all your service visits?

As your own personal troubleshooter, I excel in following up with in-progress projects and services, I stay abreast with the latest technologies that matter to you and I keep you in the loop on what you need to know to help you stay productive.

Check out my [recommendations](/recommendations/), [articles](updates/) and, [publications](/publications) on technology to see how I can help you shortcut many lapses in productivity.
