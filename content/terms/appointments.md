If you require an at-location or in-shop consultation [contact me](/#contact) to make an appointment.  Please note that making appointments with me require both of us to be prompt and communicative about delays/cancellations ahead of time by at least 2hrs. If I fail to show up for our appointment I will wave the first hour of the consultation.  If I am late for an appointment over 10mins I will take %25 off your fee. If you fail to show up you agree to pay the first 1 hour of consultation fee. If you fail to contact me, or contact me under 2hrs before the consultation about a delay/cancellation, or show up late, you agree to a %25 addition to the fee. Please see my [rates](/#rates) for more information.
