## Protecting Your Data 

**I make every effort to protect your data, but I am  not responsible nor liable for preserving your data, or knowing what kind of data existed before the servicing of any device.** I perform backups of your device a before a start a service, but my backups are for internal use and done for safety reasons only. If something goes wrong with a servicing, I can use this backup to restore the computer to its original configuration. This means that whatever data was on the device, completely gets restored from my safety backup. Due to the way in which my backup software takes a snapshot of the storage entire device. I also verify the image is intact after the back up so there is no possibility of data loss at any point during my safety backups. If you receive your device back after servicing and notice a loss of data, look to your backups, or verify the data did not get moved to another location. Also, I only keep this backup for up to 4 months after the servicing. It's important that you do not rely on my backups because you could misplace or forget where your data lives and assume data is lost when, in fact, it did exist on the device in the first place, or it got moved before your device entered into my possession. It's always important to make your own backups, and maintain knowledge of what data you have and where it lives before requesting any service, if you need help performing your own backups, contact me and I will send you info. If you need extended guidance, contact me to help you with your backup strategy. Under dire situations, if you contact me in the 4 month period, and you need more time, I may, at my discretion, hold on to the backup image for 2 extra months, totaling 6 months. There is no guarantee that the data you are looking to retrieve, exists in my backups. **For my own specific liability reasons, I cannon hold onto data any longer than the time that was specified and will have to delete it to protect your privacy with in the time periods specified above.** 

## Software Bugs - Hardware Wear & Tear
In the process of updating software, or making changes to the way software functions on your device, bugs and errors can be introduced by the way in which software interacts with the operating system. Also failures in the functioning of hardware could be introduced as a result of my servicing. Some of the resulting failures could be related to, but not limited to: design flaws, wear and tear, glitches, bugs, you or any third party mishandling of hardware/software prior to servicing or improper maintenance. If this situations arises, additional costs outside the quoted or estimated fees might be required. My liability and responsibility stops at my [service guarantee](service-guarantee). If I fail to complete a specific piece of work, or I misconfigure/mishandle your device I will take responsibility.

## Communication and Equipment Left Behind
I am very proactive in keeping you in the loop on the status of your device. If for some reason I do not hear back from you on a communication for a period of 120 days, depending on my time constraints, and any arrangements we have, such as a lengthy pending shipment of a replacement part, I may have to recycle/retire your device after your data has been securely removed. I will make an effort to contact you, even though I am not required to. This may involve all of the following during this 120 day period: a few calls, an email, a text message (If a mobile number is on file), and a post letter(IF I have an address for you on file). If I am not able to reach you, or you do not respond to any of my communications within this time frame, regardless of the reason, I am assuming you do not want whatever equipment you have left behind, and your equipment will be irrevocably destroyed or may be sold to cover any costs. I will do my best to secure wipe your data to protect your privacy, but I am not liable for any results that occur from any kind of breach to your personal data from devices that are in my care even though I excel at protecting your data while your device is in my care. For more information about the my limited liability and protection of your data, please see my [privacy](/terms/privacy) terms.
