This guide shows you how to scan and remove duplicate photos using the PC application "[dupeGuru](https://dupeguru.voltaicideas.net/)".

Launch DupeGuru from the desktop icon. Select the application mode for the appropriate files you are going to be scanning for: Standard, Music, or Pictures.

Since this guide is going to be for Pictures choose that mode.

You may have to wait some time, depending on the size of the selected folders.

Eventually a list of matches appears on screen. Original files are marked in blue, with duplicates underneath, so tick individual files or select Mark and Mark All to tick everything at once. Files can be deleted, or copied or moved to another location for checking.
