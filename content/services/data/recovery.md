## Data Recovery
{{% alert title="STOP!" url="" %}}
If you experienced a loss on a device you are currently using, unless you have a backup of your lost/damaged data that you want me attempt to recover, it's important that you stop using your device immediately after you notice the loss, or failure, as further use could prevent a full recovery.
{{< /alert >}}


It's very likely that I can recover data from your damaged device, or your data loss. The chances of recovery depend on a number of factors: If you own a Hard Disk Drive, or Solid State Storage device. The state of the damage/loss on the device, or if you data was deleted, or wiped. In some cases you might have a backup of your damaged or lost data and if so, in many cases data can be recovered from this backup. I will need to perform an analysis on your device, to confirm that the lost/damaged data can be recovered.

- Data Recovery turn-Around times and costs can vary. Turn-around times can take between 1 day to 3 weeks depending on my time constraints, and the state of your device. If physical damage exists on your device, the particular damage may significantly slow your device's recovery time. Check below for price ranges.
- The recovery fee portion covers a full recovery of the data you need.



###  Supported Storage Devices

- Hard Disk Drives
- Solid State Drives
- Flash Memory Drives
- Floppy/Tape Media
- Optical Media (CD/R DVD/R)


### Analysis/Handling
{{% alert title="**No Refunds on Inital Analysis/Handling Fee**" url="" %}} The service below includes a damage report and a quote to recovery the data. Turn-around time from analysis to recovery can range between 1-3 days, or 1 to 3 weeks depending on the extent of the damage/loss. In rare cases, due to the nature of select cases of systemic damage, certain recovery cases may take 1-3 months for research, testing and full recovery.  {{< /alert >}}

Under my Analysis/Handling fee I will determine which category your data loss issue falls under in the following types of recovery. Please note for data recovery there is no charge (Except for the Analysis/Handling Fee) until the data you want is recovered.

Data recovery rates for a functioning device (device powers on, and is accessible via the hardware interface.)

### Advanced Recovery (Minimal Hardware Damage)

{{% service-range item-min="$800" item-max="$4000" %}}
Data recovery rates for a non-functioning HDD (Device does not detect, power on, or does power on, but the contents of the file system cannot be read in any meaningful way, necessitating a mechanical failure recovery.)

### Catastrophic Recovery (Critical Hardware Damage)
{{% service-range item-min="$1300" item-max="$5000" %}}
Data recovery rates for a non-functioning Solid State Device such as a USB flash drive or a SSD drive (Device does not detect, power on, or does power on, but the contents of the file system cannot be read in any meaningful way, necessitating a mechanical failure recovery.)

## Password/System Recovery

If you are unable to access your device, or data, I can help you gain access the to data, or equipment. 

You must own the equipment, or have power of attorney to act on the owners behalf. I will need documentation confirming that you purchased the equipment, or a document stating that you have authority to act on behalf of the owner to allow me to service the equipment.
