{{% alert title="I stand with Ukraine & Palestine" %}} I support all people's right to freedom and sovereignty from repressive colonial systems through non-cooperation. Please speak out against tyranny in your own way as we all share this Earth. Using violence, or the threat of violence, to subjugate a people for political gain, or any other reason, is unacceptable. Humans were born with the right to be free from oppression.{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="2024 OEM Computer Service Changes" url="/updates/update-deceptive-design-recent-computers-laptops/" %}} Many current Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), Dell, HP, Lenovo, Sony, Toshiba, and Apple recently have been making design changes to their products that impact my services to you. **If you plan on upgrading to, or purchasing a new computer**, I will recommend a custom-made computer, instead of an OEM Computer that you purchase from a computer store. This will affect some of my services to you. I can still handle most repair issues with OEM computers, but I will no longer be performing hardware upgrades to any OEM Models...[more](/updates/update-deceptive-design-recent-computers-laptops/){{% /alert %}}

  Once you’ve paid money for a product, the manufacturer shouldn’t be able to dictate how you use it—it’s yours. Ownership means you should be able to open, hack, repair, upgrade, or tie bells on it.
Support the [right to repair](https://www.repair.org/) and sane [copyright legislation](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/fixcopyright/).{{% /alert %}}

Big Tech and Big Content are oppressing creativity. It’s time to #EndCreativeMonopolies by reimagining our archaic copyright laws to put artists before Disney, Amazon, Spotify, &amp; News Corp. Take action in support of artists everywhere.{{% /alert %}}
