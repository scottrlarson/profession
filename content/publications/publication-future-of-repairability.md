This article came about due to my concern with our current age of throw-away technology. Since I have been repairing computers and laptops since the early 2000s, I am in a particular position to see firsthand where the environmental sustainability of modern technology is heading.

In the last couple of years, laptop technology has been advancing in a direction of portability. Reducing the weight and size of technology enriches how we live. We now have mobile devices that are ultra-portable, making it possible to connect with friends and family or create works of art, anywhere in the world.

What hasn't advanced along with the portability of technology is the ecological impact we are having on the environment under this current paradigm of upgrading and discarding.

The fault lies somewhere in the middle. The symbiosis between our need for new technology (to improve our lives) and the systems make and sell this technology. 

In the pursuit of innovation, we are creating a vast waste footprint. This problem appears to be very hard to solve. Recycling devices only produce about 2[0% of usable materials](https://circleit.us/blogs/news/the-e-waste-crisis) that can be put back into use for other products. This means that 80% has to be used in ways other than recycling. I think we all know where the rest goes, in the landfill. That means our planet. It's a major problem that is going to require the smartest people on the planet to solve.

Right now, most laptop and tablet manufacturers are not doing all they can to make these devices last. It's not entirely their fault. For the most part, they are responding to forces that are driven by the needs of the market. So although manufacturers have a part to play in creating better options for recycling and re-use, it's up to us to decide how this is going to play out by our purchasing and discarding decisions.

This is why I am starting to recommend customers move away from throw-away devices and invest in tech that is sustainable.

This year, the company [Framework](https://frame.work/) created a laptop that is easy to repair and upgrade. Recently, many of the laptops I get in for repairs have been difficult to upgrade and service. The reason for this, at least from the reports from manufacturers is that to make technology smaller, sacrifices need to be made in the device's **reparability** options. The reality is that it's more complicated than that and the whole truth isn't being addressed. It is cheaper, and in some cases can create better performance and reliability, to design hardware that has everything integrated, I.E does not have external **components** that can be changed out. The problem with this approach is that when one component fails on an integrated platform, the whole device needs to be replaced, this puts a higher cost burden on the customer, which manufacturers knowingly make a profit from. Compared to designing technology to be upgraded and reused, this approach creates more waste over time.

![Framework's Repair it yourself option](https://www.scottrlarson.com/img/publications/future-repairibility/repairibility.avif)

Framework is the first company, that I know of, that could be in a position to put a dent in this problem. The fact that this particular laptop even exists cuts through the lies and puts to shame Apple's [argument](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/30/apple-right-to-repair-consumer-harm/) that from a security and reliability perspective it's not a good idea to make devices more repairable.

Framework's endeavor is something I haven't seen since the beginning of the home computer movement. When Personal Computers were first introduced, they had a modular design.

If the Framework laptop is anything at all, it's hard proof that you can build something thin and light without sacrificing repairability and this one idea will stick in our collective memory for a long time. As it stands now, the insides of laptops have horribly unfriendly designs.

## Solutions

If the Framework Laptop catches on, it's one possibility that might be worth investing in. You can [purchase an assembled](https://frame.work/#laptop-configuration) unit or an [assemble-it yourself]( https://frame.work/products/laptop-diy-edition/configuration/edit) option from Framework now. Starting at $1000, the cost of a Framework Laptop is about $200-$300 more than a comparable model that is currently on the market. None of Framework's competition have anything close to the expandability and repairability of Framework's offering. I see the increase in cost as an early adoption investment for any person who wants to support sustainability. 

If the Framework laptop is not for you, there are other options:

[**Donate to charity**](http://www.globalstewards.org/donate-computers.htm)**:** If you think your old PC is no longer usable and just taking up space, donate it to a charitable organization. There are quite a few non-profit organizations that use old computers for administrative or instructional purposes.

[**Recycle**](https://www2.calrecycle.ca.gov/WhereToRecycle/)**:** If your computer is too old to be of use to someone or is damaged beyond repair, don’t throw it away—recycle it. Some computer manufacturers offer nationwide programs to help the environment by recycling used computers. Check with the waste and recycling service in your city to find out if there are any special instructions to follow regarding the disposal of old computer equipment.

No matter what you do with an obsolete computer, make sure you have your [**data securely erased**](https://scottrlarson.com/services/data/erasing) before it leaves your control.
