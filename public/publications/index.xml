      <description>I am a computer professional that helps the public with technology. I have been troubleshooting computer problems for over 25 years. To find out more about me, visit my home page.
Here I am, back in Windows. I&amp;rsquo;m realizing that my journey to a Freedom-Of-Choice Desktop environment is riddled with traps from my past. My familiarity with the apps and processes of Windows haunts my every move. It&amp;rsquo;s challenging to find replacements and workarounds for what I used to be able to do&amp;hellip; But then my determination kicked in.</description>

      <description>In the last couple of years, laptop technology has been advancing in a direction of portability. Reducing the weight and size of technology enriches how we live. We now have mobile devices that are ultra-portable, and with these advancements it makes it possible to connect with friends and family, or create works of art, anywhere in the world.
What hasn&amp;rsquo;t advanced along with the portability of technology is the ecological impact we are having on the environment under this current paradigm.</description>

      <title>Taking Windows 11 For a Spin - The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</title>

      <description>Update (2022/03/14): Due to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s anti-competitive practices, I can no longer recommend Windows 11 for use. For the average computer user, there is not many alternatives right now so I will continue to support customers who install and use it. You can read more about my stance in my transition to the Linux Operating System for my own use.
Even though I think Windows 11 has potential in future releases, I strongly recommend NOT INSTALLING it until mid-2023 as it has major stability issues that can cause productivity concerns with your device.</description>

      <description>We are in an age where password security is becoming very important to our ability to function in society, but not for the reasons you expect. The password strength, although a problem, isn&amp;rsquo;t the real problem. The real problem is having to remember passwords for the multitude of online accounts we are forced to create to survive in the modern age of technology. In a survey performed last year by Digital Guardian, an average person or business associates their email address with 130 accounts.</description>

      <description>During my repairs, I receive quite a few PC laptops that are designed and constructed on the cheap. I speak to each of my customers about their purchasing choice, and if they can remember, it usually boils down to a purchase by marketing gimmick. While researching this publication, I looked up this phrase and the search results seem to think that performing a marketing gimmick is a great idea. Where I come from, marketing gimmicks are used to obfuscate the true colors of a product.</description>

      <description>It is relatively easy from the standpoint of a thief to impersonate your online identity and assume your financial standing. Using your identity, a thief can open up a line of credit under your name and go on a shopping spree making you assume all of the responsibility until you rectify the problem. As more and more of our personal information gets warehoused online, protecting information against theft is a continuing challenge on both sides of the fence, customers and financial institutions alike.</description>

      <description>Smartphones are much more than simple tools to make calls and take pictures. They have become our personal assistants. Storing everything about us.

It&amp;rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of, its important for our society to be open.</description>

      <description>We live in an age of mobile devices. We are accustom to replacing a device before it needs maintenance with the exception of laptop&amp;rsquo;s and desktops. If you have a device that you want to keep as long as possible, maintenance is the glue that holds the operation of your device together. Just like your prized automobile, changing out the tires and oil keeps it operational for your most important trips.</description>

      <description>A disaster recovery backup solution preserves a local copy of all data: Desktop Settings, Programs, and personal/business data like (Documents, Pictures or Music) onto a local, network, or cloud based storage device. If any of your working device components fail catastrophically, your system state (all data related to the functioning of your device and your productivity) can be restored to a previous state (before the disaster) in full running condition with minimal down time.</description>
