## Late/No Shows

**At-Your Location**

I reserve the right to charge you a full fee or half fee in the event that you are over 10mins late or do not show up when I arrive at your location and do not call me ahead of time, by at least 3 hrs before the appointment. The cost will be determined by how far I have to travel, If I could have had other same time appointment that day, or how you respond to being held accountable for being late or not showing up. If for any reason I feel like my time is being wasted I will charge you for my time, and that will be the end of our arrangement. My time is just as valuable as your time, please consider that when you are making appointments with me. If you give me notice before hand that you might late and you specific how late you might be and follow though with that then there will be no charge, communication is key.

**In-Shop/Office**

I am a bit more flexible when you visit my office for being late as I know traffic and other issues can cause problems for being timely and since I didn't make a special visit to your location. But if it becomes a habit more than twice I may reserve the right to charge you for loss of time. I reserve the right to charge you half of my regular fee if you are later than 20mins to an appointment with out 3hrs advance notice. Full fee if you fail to show up without giving me 3hr advance notice.

When I am late or do not show: I will compensate you by giving you a discount on my first hour fee on your or my next visit. The discount will be determined by the lateness of my visit or if I didn't show up at all due to my fault: I.E forgot about the appointment, or was late getting out of a previous appointment and failed to call at least 3 hours in advance.
