After receiving a custom built computer, or hardware upgrade from me, I recommend:

- If you need to reinstall the OS, be sure to confirm in BIOS that post-os software helpers have been disabled. **If I have built, or performed a hardware upgrade on your computer, that may have already been done by me.**
- Uninstall and don't use OneDrive: The way in which Onedrive moves data from the local user folders to the cloud to sync data between all devices opens you up to data loss and stability/performance problems. 
- I recommend not installing manufacturer software that aims to control LED or Fan options or makes it easier to isntall drivers like Armory Crate, MSI Dragon, ect from the Mainboard Manufacturer. Manufacture's have been lax with software stability and now they are using there software packages to sell you products and harvest data. Avoid at all costs. Try [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/) instead.
- Keep Windows 11 Security features enabled, virus protection, firewall, and all core isolation options. This may prevent games with kernel-level anti-cheat from working. I strongly believe that if a game needs that level of access to the system, its not worth the pain and effort of troubleshooting post issues. Any publisher that requires this level of control for the game to function is suspect. I receive many computers for repair with these specific problems, avoid like your life depends on it.
