Its very important to me that I provide the best possible service and that means that after I completed my service on your device, I want to return your device to you in a timely manner. I rely on you to provide me with timely responses to my requests, especially if you require a quick turn-around on the service of your device. 

In certain cases, failure to follow up on my request for communication in a timely manner may increase the chance of a delay with other customer's services. If this happens, I reserve the right to charge you a bench fee of $65 dollars per delayed communication.
