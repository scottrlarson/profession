## The Problem.
A day after the Northern California firestorm in 2017 a customer called me: "Scott, our house burnt down to the ground, our computers are gone, can you get us up and running with new computers, and restore our data from Carbonite?"

Even though it was the day after having escaped to the coast with my family at first I was dazed by the disaster, I didn't fully realize myself how people would be effected by this catastrophe. That day I was able to order two new laptops from dell's online store, install Carbonite, and restore the customer’s data. The customer was up and running in about a week.

Having a cloud or rotating storage device backup system. is important. Fire damage is a real threat in California moving forward. Consider having some kind of backup strategy for a disaster like this so you don't lose important data. Ask your self the following question: What can I afford to lose if a disaster like this strikes again?

In 1989 my home was involved in a fire and I lost everything. I had some backups but they were in the house when it happened. I had to start all over it was tough but doable.

Think about where you can store your data. If the information is private you might want to avoid the cloud, unless a encryption solution is involved. Having data stored on drives is good but what happens if the storage devices are in the location when the disaster strikes? Plan on keeping backups of your most important data on separate media that can be stored at another family/friends house, or even a safety deposit box.

## The Resolution
