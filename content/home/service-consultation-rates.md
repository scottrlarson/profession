Consultations can happen in my office, or at your location. Rates are based on location and distance and starts at $110 an hour for In-Office appointments and up to $137 (within a 5mile radius from Downtown Santa Rosa) an hour for at-location appointments, with a one hour minimum. Depending on my service load, at-office/home appointments usually carry a three hour to one day scheduling buffer. When my service load is high, I reserve the right to push at-location appointments service requests to a lower priority, between one to three days, or in rare cases, up to a week. If you need a faster arrival visit priority, or a weekend visit and are willing to pay twice the normal rate per hour, please specify that in your communication. My availability depends on the level of my In-office drop-off service load. [Contact me](/#contact) for more information.
