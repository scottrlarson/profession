      <description>Prime95 Prime95 is a handy tool for overclockers and system stability checkers, Prime95 has a feature called &amp;ldquo;Torture Test&amp;rdquo; that allows maximum stress testing on the CPU and RAM. There are several options allowing the stress test to focus on the memory, processor, or a balance of both.
Usually Prime95 will detect an error within a matter of minutes if an overclock is not stable, however many people like to let the system &amp;ldquo;burn-in&amp;rdquo; overnight to ensure long-term stability.</description>

      <description>LatencyMon LatencyMon checks if a system running Windows is suitable for processing real-time audio and other tasks. LatencyMon analyzes the possible causes of buffer underruns by measuring kernel timer latencies and reporting DPC and ISR execution times as well as hard pagefaults. It will provide a comprehensible report and find the kernel modules and processes responsible for causing audio latencies which result in drop outs. It also provides the functionality of an ISR monitor, DPC monitor and a hard pagefault monitor.</description>
