Along the way of providing technical services to the public, I noticed great suffering happening on a spiritual level between myself and the world. I realized, I could no longer sit by and watch my world be destroyed by inaction. Today I work very hard to bring my world into alignment with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cosmic-Universal-Laws-Infinite-Prosperous-ebook/dp/B019MON6MI">Cosmic Spiritual Law</a> though my own personal activism. I follow strict cosmic codes that govern behavior centered around cause and effect. Every action has an equal an opposite reaction. This principle is well known to apply in physics, but it also operates in every area of life. Harm creates harm, and goodness creates goodness. There are no exceptions. The biggest problem to understanding this concept is knowing what actions cause harm, and what actions cause good. For me, this is a life journey, lived though the heart, that I take to find resolution. You can find out more about these codes from the [7 hermetic principles](https://www.amazon.com/Kybalion-Hermetic-Philosophy-Illustrated-Annotated/dp/0943217210?psc=1) which is based on the Hermetic teachings.</p>

Spiritual Activism is the coming together of spirituality and activism. It is not about religion, it is not about any form of dogma, it is activism that comes from the heart, not just the head, activism that is compassionate, positive, kind, fierce and transformative. Being a spiritual activist means taking responsibility for my part in creating the change I want to see in the world. Living in a spirit of positivity, compassion, and love with a balance of independence and self determination. Nothing could be more inspiring and more rewarding than being the change I want to see in the world, within and without.

{{% alert title="Personal Interests Warning" url="/education/apprentice-opportunity" %}}If you are a customer, or potentially want to be a customer of mine, reading about my personal interests and beliefs might be more than you want to know about me. I strive for professionalism by refraining from bringing up personal interest topics unless asked. In many cases, I like to keep discussions amount my personal life in the office and on at-location appointments brief as I do not want to taint our business relationship with my philosophical beliefs.{{% /alert %}}

In 2019 I suffered a Cerebral Hemorrhage. I wrote a [book](/publications/publication-most-improved/) about the experience of overcoming depression and how choosing mental/emotional strife over peace plays a direct role in shaping life.
