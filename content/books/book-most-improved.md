A story of transformation from selfishness to selflessness.

> "Most Improved" is a meditation on the process of personal transformation. I experienced a transformation from a "self-centered" worldly view on life, to a "universe-connected" consciousness, where all life has meaning. In August of 2017, I suffered a Cerebral Hemorrhage. While at work, I collapsed, was taken to the hospital, and diagnosed with high blood pressure. My recovery was a miracle, I suffer only minor damage to my body's sensory systems, that improved over time. While recovering in the ICU, and realizing that I was not going to die, I got in touch with a deep feeling of apathy, and sadness about my life.  I realized that previously, I was covering up these feelings with day-to-day distractions. I decided that if I was going to survive, I was going to live differently this time. This determination brought me to place where I developed an understanding on how to really live. I learned from many people including: Mark Passio, James Allen, and David K. Reynolds. I combine Hermetic principles with the Constructive Living practices of David K. Reynolds, and I filter all of that though the ethical teachings of James Allen. In this book I expose how aligning oneself to Cosmic Law brings true happiness. If you want to experience a fellow "life-traveler's" view on overcoming depression, or just want to learn about the state of the world from a modern, self-learned philosopher, then this book is for you.
