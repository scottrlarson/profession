<p>If you fail to show up and fail to contact me about a delay or no show to a appointment where I require your presence I will bill you a minimum hour fee for my time. Please see my rates available on my home page of my website at http://scottrlarson.com</p>
<p>I require a 3 hour notice on cancellations. If you cancel a appointment in the three hour window I will charge you half my billable rate given that particular service. </p>
