From a technology and culture perspective This piece is a look at where we have been, and where we are heading as a society. This article is a companion piece to "Reflections on the Home Computer Golden Age". 

[TOC]
 
I wrote this article with the need to tell my family how life was before technological boom of 2000. But with how pervasive technology is in all our lives, its important to understand the direction our world is taking by our awareness and our choices.

Currently, technological innovation is being driven by consumption instead of by culture. We don't really know it, but we live in the confines of a few "[Walled Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform)". Apple, Microsoft, and Google. All of them have developed technology that has made our lives better, no doubt about that. But since these are for-profit companies, it appears to me, that the focus for these endeavors are centered around profit. Maybe this position is inevitable by being a publicly trade company on the stock market. Or maybe it happens because companies become to large and the social dynamic between individual workers change. What ever the reason is, when choice becomes limited, and I mean how the tech we use has artificial limitations built into it solely for profit, because its the necessary thing to do for the company, and not for the people who use it, we all suffer. 

Linux might change this situation someday. In my view, its positioning itself to be more friendly operating system for everyone. Someday we may see all the technology we use built on the Penguin. My hope is that a community of culture and freedom conscience developers will be the ones designing products that put people first, and profit second. Microsoft's anti-customer changes to Windows 11 was the last straw for me, I saw it coming with Windows 10 forced updates and the direction they were going with online-only accounts. I recently switched my operations to Linux because of this and [wrote](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-transition-windows-to-linux/) about why.  

This time in history should be recorded, for all of us. I often look back at what the Amiga platform could have been. I see it as community driven technology that was ahead of its time, and I often wonder what kind of world we would live in the Amiga platform survived. I think we would be at least 5 or 10 years more advanced than we are now, technology would be based on the Open mindset, and companies would have there place in a limited fashion of designing hardware and software for the community instead of driving society into closed ecosystems.

Currently choice is being driven through a consumption driven model. For the average customer of computer products, it might not be a visible issue, but lately operating systems are being subtlety designed more and more to prevent choice. You can read more about this dilemma in my article above. (I still service computers that have Windows, but I no longer use Windows as my everyday driver).


I'm a avid supporter of open source software now. Before my Windows revelation, I used many closed source products for my creativity, Mainly Adobe products which are in the same Walled Garden camp as the Operation System Market. I work very hard now to use software that is not owned and controlled by any one company. Over the years, its been my experience that endeavors that have a primary focus of social or technological change for the sake of making the world better, development of software tends to move in a direction of enabling choice for the user. When profit motives are deeply invested in software from the get-go, there seems to be a change in direction at some point to give users less choice to keep the profit margins going for investors. I have found that this stifles innovation and harms the [common good - the procedural formulations definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good). I understand profit as an end to good will, not solely a means to get a personal outcome. If the means is put before the end, that usually tends to corrupt the endeavor. "The end justifies the means" is at the heart of this problem. A heart based outcome cannot be experienced for the common good by following this ethical approach. 

The experiences I had through this journey, especially the games that have inspired me to think deeply on life, got me thinking about my own place in the universe, and who I want to be. To a large extent, in civilized living at least, society tends to mold mold us into different parts of machine that keeps marching on. I'm not sure how successful I am at detaching myself, I guess it depends on what your understanding of success is. Searching for the true meaning of life and humanity's true origins keeps me going. As I was growing up, charting my own course was always in the back of my mind. I know I want to try and figure it who I am now, instead of letting the world tell me who I was. My entire life, it seems, is a self-educated quest for identity.


## Thoughts when writing this article

If you were one of those "Enthusiast" kids back in my day, ridicule and shame came with the territory. During the Industrial Revolution, If you weren't doing something productive, something was wrong with you. I didn't want people to think that I was odd, so I developed a cover story to hide my computer gaming obsession by doing something constructive with "That Contraption" as people like to call them.  I learned C64 basic, the coding language at the time and speech synthesizing (Converting text into speech). If all I was doing, was playing games, I was a nobody with no future in everyone's mind.

Looking back at the introduction of the Home Computer, I wonder if big business (Companies that were invested in large scale computing), feeling threatened by the success of computer enthusiasm used the social stigma against being different to sow mistrust of what creative computing could be. At the time, I found that the general public often reacted negatively to computer technology. Could this artificially created hysteria be passed onto the general public through the media causing the general public to treat this new technology with suspicion? 

I imagine most people at the time thought, and maybe currently think now, that computer games are peripheral to what is going on in the world. In fact, I think there was a real stigma to art and entertainment in my childhood years. Everyone in my neck of the woods seemed to want to appear like they were doing something of importance, that usually meant having a good job with some well known corporation, and making sure we appeared to be supporting capitalism. 

Some of that must have rubbed off on me, because to this day, I still feel empty if I am not doing something externally productive with my life. After reflecting on my childhood experiences with computer gaming, I realized that games, and having fun, are a basic fundamental of being human. Sound, graphics, and story elements, that reflect the challenges we are facing in modern society had a real impact on my artistic direction. It helped me explore the real problems with our culture's need to [dominate other cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony). There is a great documentary on the independent gaming culture and it's positive impact on the developers of games as they were growing up called "[Gameloading: Rise of the Indies](https://gameloading.vhx.tv/videos/gameloading-stereo)" if you are interested in exploring the topic. 

During my early Home Computer life I was combining what I knew about electronics from my Uncle by adding modifications to my C64 peripherals. A few crude applications I can remember implementing, were to save power of my peripherals and increase the operating speed of disk drives, which usually result in read/write problems. These kinds of modifications to hardware were probably directly related to why I choose a path of building gaming computers for myself and friends, which eventually inspired me to start my own computer repair business.

In the early seventies, IBM was the Goliath on the Business Computer block. They had a solid sales/marketing team and were selling 5 million dollar mainframe computers to business that could afford them. Thinking that the Home Computer craze was just a fad, they didn't take the revolution seriously. For the world-at-large, the Home Computer revolution didn't start until IBM's customers pressured the company to enter the space. IBM released the first Personal Computer called the "model 5150" more commonly known as the IBM PC. Based on a open architecture design, the 5150 became very popular. Home Computers were mainly controlled by closed designs, so it's unfortunate that it took a major player to change this paradigm, which IBM used to its own advantage to dominate the Home Computer space. IBM struggled to compete with the Home Computer market, dominated by Apple, Commodore and Tandy but by then the open architecture concept changed the game completely. Home Computer companies started offer there own PC clones to stay in the game. Standards in hardware and software design, based on the open architecture philosophy, brought great innovation to the world of Computers and with it, an era of endless possibilities for the hobbyist.

You can read more about my thoughts around closed designs in the everyday software we use in my "[My transition from Windows to Linux in an anti-customer age](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-transition-windows-to-linux/)" article and the movement to back again to open hardware platforms in my "[Will one repairable laptop change the world?](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-future-of-repairability/)" article.

## What Writing Projects am I working on Today

Writing for Fiction is somewhat of a moving target for me. I start on one project, and then my understanding of life changes and I move into a new project.

I'm still interested in writing a science fiction story about humanities origins. Not from the typical stand point of what we know about the universe. We really don't know much, at least in terms of how the universe and consciousness was created. I know we have a lot of theories that seem grounded in chaos theory. I believe on the surface, our minds perceive that the universe behaves like a machine, but at its heart is something else. I believe that Hermetic principles have the best chance of helping us understand how the Universe operates. Mainstream scientific views are too nondeterministic. Life is much more organized and orderly that we realize, and there is some kind of interaction between all life and "The All" as Hermeticists like to put it. 

The human family doesn't really have an origin story. That history has been lost by time. Think of children who loses or lost one or more of their parents. Apply that scenario to the human condition and maybe you can see why civilized humanity is in such a sorry state right now. We don't really know where we came from, religions have their stories but they always felt incomplete and overly archaic to me. 

So it would be nice to have a story of humanity, even if its just fiction as I feel that would help us have some understanding of our place in the universe. 

My story roots comes from the idea that there was a first human civilization on earth that was lost by a world disaster in ancient times. Over generations knowledge has been lost and rediscovered, but not completely, and we are remnants of that civilization.
