Due to my particular field, and the fact that I am a one man shop in isolation, and I operate by appointment, which allows me to control the stream of customers, I am remaining in operation. I am taking every precaution necessary to prevent the spread of this virus.

For in-office servicing, I am seeing one customer at a time, by appointment. Walk-in customers who show up while I am with a customer, will be asked to phone me to make an appointment.

When a customer arrives with a device that needs to be serviced, I have created the following procedures to minimizing the handling of it: 

   1. I am using disposable Vinyl Gloves when handling the device. 
   2. Once the device is in my office, I immediately hook it up to my attached Keyboard, Video & Mouse environment. This allows me to access the device without having to physically be at the device itself. 
   3. When the servicing is complete, I wipe down the outside of the device with 70% Ethyl Rubbing Alcohol.

When I schedule an appointment to visit your home or office, or when you visit my office for a consultation to provide a service, we agree to maintain six feet distance, and I will be using disposable Vinyl Gloves in handling equipment.
