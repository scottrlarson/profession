Dear customers, due to the out of control price gouging in rent prices I am no longer living at Santa Rosa, I have relocated to Sebastopol. I still service the Santa Rosa community by appointment at my new office: Share Exchange, located at 533 5th Street. If you happen to be in the area and want to drop by, see if I am in first. Or you can schedule an appointment by calling me at 707-536-1527, texting me on my cell at 707-416-5811, or <a href="/contact/">contacting me</a> from the website.
