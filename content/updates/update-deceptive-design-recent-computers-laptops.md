Very recently, OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturers of consumer desktops and laptops, like Dell, HP and Sony, etc.) have been introducing new features into the Basic Input/Output System (the system that controls all the hardware in a computer).

These features are put in under the guise of protecting the consumer, but in practice they are unnecessary and over-complicating the setup and experience, reducing ownership power and ownership privacy. As a technology service provider, these changes are making harder to provide services to you.

I have decided that it's no longer a good business decision to have to conform to the limitations these changes place on my services.

Because of the evolution of the internet, the computer industry has been going through a lot of changes in the last couple of years. Some of these changes are good for society, and some are not. For now, manufacturers, who design and sell off-the-shelf consumer computer parts, parts that go into making a computer, are not affected by the anti-customer changes OEM providers are currently making to consumer grade computers. But there is mounting pressure to design hardware around a closed security model where the market-dominating companies can dictate how hardware is developed.

Please note that the OEM providers are not required to follow certain standards like the rest of the computer industry that sell computer parts. They can and do make for-profit changes to the equipment they design. These kinds of changes, that are made to hardware and software, run counter to open design/development standards, usually an attempt to monopolize a market, or gather data from its customers without informed consent. To read more about this topic, see my articles on "<a href="https://www.scottrlarson.com/categories/deceptivetechnology/">DeceptiveTechnology"</a>

If you plan on upgrading to, or purchasing a new desktop computer, I recommend, and will build, a custom-made computer, instead of recommending an OEM Computer that you purchase from a computer store. For laptops, I recommend a [Framework](https://frame.work/) Laptop. Framework builds laptops around sustainability. Their design choices reflect open standards. Please note that there is a price difference and a longer turn-around time in setting up a custom built computer, or purchasing a sustainable laptop. Depending on your needs, plan on spending $1000 or more.

This will affect some of my services to you. I can still handle most repair issues with OEM computers, but I will no longer be performing hardware upgrades to any OEM Models.

I apologize if this inconveniences you in any way.

List of features or actions that are encumbering the setup and experiencing of consumer grade computers and laptops (Please note that these features can be helpful for business environments, but they are not necessary and are a cause for concern in consumer environments):

- Secure Boot Certification Authorities (A setting used to prevent operating system alternatives from being installed)
- Preventing or creating friction in disabling Secure Boot
- Enabling/Disabling USB ports
- Preventing, or creating friction in detection of aftermarket parts
- Any physical system design characteristic which prevents, or creates friction in repairing, replacing or upgrading components (using glue to mount components, hiding mounting screws or making casing more difficult to remove).
- Using market dominance to pressure repair shops, or third party component manufacturers to abide my anti-competitive practices by making it more difficult to find and obtain parts.
