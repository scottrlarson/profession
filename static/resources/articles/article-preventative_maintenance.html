<h2>How to prolong your Computer's life with Preventative Maintenance</h2>
<h3>Have you ever wondered why your computer failed after a year or two when it should have lasted three to five years?</h3>
<h4>Here are the top three reasons why:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Wear and tear</li>
<li>Power surges</li>
<li>Overheating</li>
</ol>
<p>We had a customer who dropped off a dell desktop after the hard drive failed. The customer owned the computer for only two years before the breakdown and wondered why he was having problems so soon with the hardware. Noticing that his computer was full of dust in and around the ventilation ports resulting in poor air flow, we pointed this out to the customer. Shocked he decided to have regular maintenance done on his computer in the future.</p>
<p>Yes, even dust can result in poor circulation which exposes your hardware to extreme temperature and over time can result in catastrophic failure.</p>
<h3>What to look for when you need preventative maintenance service:</h3>

</div>
<p>Inspect the ventilation ports for dust. Ventilation dust accumulates over time and builds up on the ventilation ports clogging the air flow. If the computer is on listen for any unusual sound which points to a fan going bad. Hardware damage occurs when air flow is impeded for an extended period of time from months to years. This can result in a total loss of your data, or a costly rebuild of your software and data setup if the hardware fails due to excessive heat.</p>
