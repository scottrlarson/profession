I provide monitor and maintenance service on the reliable operation of your data backups by installing and maintaining a robust backup and disaster recovery solution. I monitor this solution on a monthly basis, update the management software when necessary, tweak backup schedules to run at opportune times, recommend replacement hardware to improve backup functionality and possibly alert you, or trigger a backup when your storage device reports a pending failure.

## Costs
$150.00 Yearly averages out to $12.50 Monthly

## What you get yearly
- Monitoring of Storage Hardware: Get a possible alert of storage hardware catastrophes before they happen. In most cases a backup can be triggered in the event of a panic situation before the storage device completely fails protecting your most recent data. \*
- The disaster recovery software and free upgrades. ($40.00 savings on a license per year) \*\*
- My disaster recovery management and maintenance of Macrium backup software and its backup jobs on a monthly basis yearly. Macrium backup software is used by many reputable companies like Ford, Acer and Disney to protect data from failures. \*\*\*
- 1 Free Recovery in the event of a catastrophic failure of a storage device or data loss. \*\*\*\*

\* S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology; often written as SMART) is a monitoring system included in computer hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and eMMC drives. Its primary function is to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability with the intent of anticipating imminent hardware failures. When S.M.A.R.T. data indicates a possible imminent drive failure, software running on the host system may notify the user so preventative action can be taken to prevent data loss, the failing drive can be replaced and data integrity maintained. Please note that this is not a full proof method to detect and resolve hardware failures before they happen. It can help to prevent data loss, but there is no guarantee that it will.

\*\* Monitoring backup jobs on a regular basis minimizes failures or faults going unchecked minimizing the build-up of recurring damage that typically cause catastrophic hardware disasters.

\*\*\* Macrium Reflect is a reliable and well a tested product for making regular backups and restores of both system and personal data. Macrium Software was founded in 2006 when CEO and Founder Nick Sills experienced a personal data disaster and in the process discovered existing backup tools were not as good as he expected. Wanting a software solution that was practical and easy to use, Nick and his team developed Macrium Reflect to create a safe and secure disk image with ultra-fast recovery times should disaster strike.


\*\*\*\* Does not include the cost of the replacement part or the labor required to install it, if any.
