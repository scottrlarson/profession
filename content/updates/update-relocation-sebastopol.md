Dear customers, due to the out of control price gouging in rent prices I am no longer living at Santa Rosa, I have relocated to Sebastopol. I still service the Santa Rosa community by appointment at my new office: located at 555 5th Street Suite 230-a. If you have a question or want to schedule an appointment [contact](/#contact) me.  If you happen to be in the area and want to drop by, see if I am in first by [phone or text](/#contact).
