I take your completed work from the processed format and perform custom design and styles conversion to the flow of the text and illustrations. I can work with many digital reading formats that are designed for reading books across multiple sized devices from phones all the way to desktop computers. The look and feel of your E-book should look like it was designed for the screen it is being read on.

I make this happen by comparing the design elements of your book from the completed work and can customize styles that don't always translate across formats when or if you use an automated tool, or when the final product isn't what you want or expect.
