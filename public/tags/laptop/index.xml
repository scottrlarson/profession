      <description>This is a really great resource for finding a laptop that meets your specifications. The site reviews laptops and then it has a search tool that allows you to filter laptops based on the recommendation points of each laptop. https://www.notebookcheck.net/Laptop-Buying-Guide-Tool.13212.0.html</description>
