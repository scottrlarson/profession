<h2>Laptop Purchasing Guidelines</h2>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">The last couple of years I have experienced a significant drop in the quality of laptops from name brand providers such as Sony, HP, and Gateway. A number of laptops have hit my bench with built-in problems ranging from poor manufacturing to cheap, low performing parts that either fail or cause performance problems.</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">I do my best to address these issues, but sometimes on a repair, I have to inform the customer that the device is suffering from these types of problems and that if its not replaced soon, wear and tear could cause further problems. The results of these defects usually become apparent a year after the warranty has expired.<!--break-->I feel a certain responsibly to educate my customers as best I can to avoid these problems in the future:</p>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">The first thing you want to do before a new Laptop purchase is to get an idea of what physical aesthetics you are going to need. Visit a store and take a look at some of the models that are on sale. You can look at laptops, pick them up, feel them and get an idea of how heavy they are before you decide to buy.</p>
<ol style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">
<li>Once you decide on one you like, make sure you write down the model number. Then when you get home, go online and look up the specifications:</li>
<li>Screen Size: the bigger the screen the better on your eye health now and in the long run (Note: also increases weight)</li>
<li>Memory: look for at least 4 gigs of ram if not more (depending on your requirements</li>
<li>Weight: If you are going to carry it around make sure its not to heavy for you.</li>
<li>Battery Life: you can usually find this information online by looking up reviews of the model on amazon or newegg.com</li>
<li>CPU Speed: The faster the processor the better. Dual Core is good, Quad Core is better (Depending on your requirements.</li>
<li>Hard Drive Speed (5400RPMs or better)</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: normal;">Once you have those specs you can used them to price out other brands. If you are looking for a cheap consumer product I recommend Asus, or Lenovo. Both of them maybe unknown to you, but in the technical field, they are very well known in quality, performance and reliability. Both manufactures approach quality with a stronger focus then most manufacturers. If you absolutely prefer Dell or HP, try to purchase one from there business line as they tend to be constructed better than the customer grade versions.</p>
