## Avoiding Scams

### Search Results

**Skipping Ads with an Adblocker**

To avoid Ad listings in search results entirely, you can use a reputable Adblocker. Be aware that not all adblockers are created equal, some disguise themselves as adblockers, but instead deliver Ad's to your computer. I use the [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) add-on/extension in Firefox and Google Chrome. It strips out Ad related content from many search engine results. This is the most effective way to protect you from malicious search results. Do not worry about losing any important results. Ad results are only companions to organic search results. If a result shows up in an Ad. I will show up in the search result if it is relevant to the search term. You might run into an occasion where you might need to whitelist a particular site from being blocked, and you can do that through the settings of the adblocker.

**Avoiding Ads with Knowledge**

If you do not want to use an Adblocker you can avoid malicious Ad results by knowing what to look for. The image below shows how Google, Yahoo, and Bing layout their Ad based search results. Headings highlighted in red contain the Ad listings. 

![Ad Laden Search Result Example 1](/img/publications/scam-avoidance/search-results-ads.png)

Search sites like those listed above have a platform for submitting Ads. This allows any "Joe" to create Ad campaigns that link directly to every day relevant search terms. 

<div class="content-block-wrap"><a href="/img/publications/scam-avoidance/google-advertising-policies.png"><img src="/img/publications/scam-avoidance/google-advertising-policies.png" alt="Google's Advertising Policies Screenshot"></a> </div>

Google has a reporting system for malicious Ads, but by the time Google gets around to correcting the problem, you can be tricked into visiting a malicious site, and if you interact with that site, by then it's usually too late. In some cases, your device can be compromised without any interaction.

Search results that are labeled "Ad" (See screen-shot above) can be redirected to an alternate site. This means that if you click on a link that you know is reputable, Google inserts itself in the middle and hijacks that link to send you to another location on the Internet. 

Ultimately you want to avoid any of the search results that fall under the label "Advertisement". Watch out for changes, many search engines change the way Ads are delivered on the search results page. Ad labeled search results usually appear at the top, a list of results can appear under one heading labeled "Advertisements", or the label is tagged to each result itself. 

Organic search results are ones that are not commercially supported and as such are less likely to have shenanigans attached to them.

### Pop-up Warnings or Error Messages

![Pop-Up Scam](/img/publications/scam-avoidance/eugjt.club-scam.jpg)

Within the scope of normal computer use, legitimate warnings or error messages never include phone numbers. Some specific business applications, like Quickbooks, are the exception. 

If you receive an error message, or warning on your screen that you cannot get out of, do not interact with it in any way. Instead, you could immediately **shutdown the computer** by way of the **power button**. You can power down the computer by **holding the power button down for 5-10 seconds and waiting until the screen goes black**. Please note that there is a slight chance of data loss when you shutdown your computer in this fashion, but if you cannot get your computer to respond to a shutdown or restart command, or use the Task Manager to kill the task in question, it is my understanding these are the only options.

### Call-based Scams

![Call center scam](/img/publications/scam-avoidance/health-center-call-center_759.jpg)

The trick to **handling inbound call scams** is to realize that, under most circumstances, obtaining computer support requires that you initiate the contact by your own means. When you receive an unsolicited call from an unknown agent, claiming to be from any legitimate establishment with the intent to offer you any kind of support, hang up. It's that simple. Remember to maintain awareness of your decision-making psychology and don't put yourself into situations that cause you to make snap decisions.

**Do not make outbound calls** from any error or warning message that appears on any of your devices. Remember the 3 indicators of a social engineering attack: **Urgency**, **Pressure**, and **Illusion of Authority**. If you need assistance, break away from the task at hand and ask a trusted person instead of blindly following a path that is laid out for you.

### Email-based Scams

![Microsoft Office365 Email Scam](/img/publications/scam-avoidance/scam-email-thunderbird.png)

Making decisions on how to respond to emails that ask you to perform an action can be tricky. There are two categories of inbound emails from any provider:

1. Legitimate requests to review information about your accounts or services.
2. Illegitimate scams that attempt to portray themselves as legitimate requests.

When you receive an email asking you to perform an action, keep in mind the three basic qualifiers of legitimacy: 

1. **Who** is the email sender? Are you receiving an email from Microsoft asking you about your email? Do you even have an email with Microsoft? Find out who your mail provider is. If it's not Microsoft, delete the message. If you do have an Email with Microsoft move on to the next step.
2. **What** is the message asking me to do? Depending on the request, you can sometimes tell that the message is suspect by the way the message is crafted, or by the nature of the request. If the email states that an account you own is on hold because of a billing problem and the message requests that you click on a link to remedy the problem, instead, open up your web browser and visit the site by using **web browser**[^web-browser] to confirm that problem exists. 
3. **Where** will I land if I act? Without clicking on any links in the email, move your mouse over the link and look at the destination URL. If it doesn't contain a recognizable location, you know you got a problem.

## Conclusion
