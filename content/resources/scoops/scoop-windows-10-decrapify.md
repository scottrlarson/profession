Due to the privacy invasions that Microsoft has implemented in Windows 10, and the unnecessary software that comes bundled with it, when I install or reinstall Windows 10 on any machine that enters this office, I remove and disable certain unnecessary and unwanted functions.(Please note that I do not guarantee any performance on any of these adjustments.):

- I disable all Telemetry and Data Collection services.
- I uninstall all Microsoft Windows 10 apps, except the basic, or useful ones that would prevent the normal operation of the device: Mail, Microsoft Store, Calculator, Sticky, Windows.photos, Soundrecorder, MSpaint, Screensketch.
- I Install new default applications to make use of: Photos(Fast Stone Image Viewer), Internet Browsing(Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome), Email(Mozilla Thunderbird) Videos(VLC), and Media Creation(Burn Aware).
