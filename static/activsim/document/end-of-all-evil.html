<p>author: Jeremy Locke</p>
<p>The End of all Evil is an inspiring take on freedom and government. Jeremy touches on a few topics that really makes you think about how our society operates: Politics, Government and Value. The basic premise is that if you allow systems and people to control your life it takes anyway from your infinite value as a human being.</p>
<p>Value is created by being free. When you accept an external entity to govern your outer life it may be a sign that you have allowed that system to obscure your value. The End of all Evil helps the reader rediscover inner value by uncovering the truth about psychopaths who use systems of politics and government to wage war on individual consciousness and gain power over people.</p>
