      <description>New desktops and laptops often are delivered with out-of-date windows components and hardware specific drivers and firmware. By upgrading and updating these components, something that is not easily done by just letting the Windows Update Service do all the heavy lifting, downtime and frustration is minimized working with a computer system that is not fully ready for operation out of the box. Also new devices are shipped with all of the Windows features enabled and in many cases, can get in the way of a smooth functioning system.</description>

      <description>Customers should watch out for a recent update to Windows 10 called &amp;ldquo;Creators Update (1709)&amp;rdquo;. The update is very big, it&amp;rsquo;s almost like installing a new version of windows. You might experience a performance hit to you device&amp;rsquo;s ability to perform while this update is downloading or installing. When the update installs it may ask to reboot your computer. There are reports of machines rebooting themselves depending on your device&amp;rsquo;s update settings.</description>
