{{< srl-alert >}}Please do not order any services if you, or, in the case of a at-location appointment, anyone in your household has shortness of breath, or has signs of any flu like symptoms.{{< /srl-alert >}}

{{< srl-alert >}}When you arrive and before you enter the building please wear mask.{{< /srl-alert >}}


{{< srl-alert >}}Walk-in customers who show up while I am with a customer, will be asked to wait in the lobby. If you cannot wait, <a href="/#contact">contact me</a> to make an appointment for a return visit.{{< /srl-alert >}}

I have created the following procedures to minimizing the handling of your device: 

 
1. Once the device is in my office, I immediately hook it up to my attached Keyboard, Video & Mouse environment. This allows me to access the device without having to physically be at the device itself to minimize excessive handling. 
2. When the servicing is complete, I wipe down the device with 70% Ethyl Rubbing Alcohol.

How you can obtain my services:

## Remote Support
Please note that if you have a working internet connection, and your device is responsive, in most cases, I can handle your issue with my <a href="/services/computer/assistance/online">Online Repair & Resolution Service</a> without a visit.

## Curbside Assistance
To maintain social distancing during this crisis, I can pick up your device directly from the curbside of my office building. Just [schedule a curbside appointment](https://harmonizely.com/scottrlarson). Call to confirm before you drop-off if you do not receive a email receipt that the appointment was scheduled.

I can also pick up your device from your curbside. If you would like me to pick up your device from your location, there is a $50 pick up/drop off fee. This fee I collect up front and is in addition to any other pre-service related fee like a diagnostic or part related fee. If you want to minimize contact and/or speed up the process of the exchange, print, fill out my [authorization form](https://www.dropbox.com/s/odow1lxexadhd0a/srl-authorization-form_savable.pdf?dl=0). You can present it to me with your device. Give me [call](/services/computer/assistance/phone/) or [text me](/services/computer/assistance/phone/) to setup a time for the exchange.

## Office Drop-Off
[Contact me](/#contact) to schedule an appointment to drop of your equipment for an office visit. I service one person, or one group (Up to 3) in my office at one time.

## In-office Consultations 
If you need advise on a technical issue [contact me](/#contact) for a phone consultation. If you need to meet with me [schedule an appointment](https://harmonizely.com/scottrlarson) for a conference room consultation.

## At-Location Appointments
I provide home/business visits. If you need priority (1-3 day scheduled in advance) service, check my [At-Location rates](/#service-consultation-rates). Otherwise at-location appointments are scheduled a week out. To protect our households, I will arrive wearing a mask to protect both parties.

At your request, I will wipe down any equipment with 70% rubbing alcohol after I have completed the service, otherwise I expect you to protect yourself by doing your own cleaning after I leave the location.
