      <title>Why everyone should use a password manager</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;We are in an age where password security is becoming very important to our ability to function in society, but not for the reasons you expect. The password strength, although a problem, isn&amp;rsquo;t the real problem. The real problem is having to remember passwords for the multitude of online accounts we are forced to create to survive in the modern age of technology. In a &lt;a href=&#34;https://digitalguardian.com/blog/uncovering-password-habits-are-users-password-security-habits-improving-infographic&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; performed last year by Digital Guardian, an average person or business associates their email address with 130 accounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of online accounts. Do you really want to try and remember that many passwords? Even worse, do you want to use the same couple of passwords for your all your online services? What if one of those sites has poor security and their password database gets compromised? That one password you use across many sites can be used by an attacker to access other accounts and make your life miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have talked to a few customers about using a password manager to circumvent this problem and the main fear is having their master password circumvented. Most password managers are not as easily accessible to online hackers (Depending on which solution you use) and it&amp;rsquo;s much more likely that one of your online accounts will be hacked instead. Plus password managers are designed to generate long, hard to guess passwords for each online service, and the application makes it easier to type those passwords into online accounts, so it&amp;rsquo;s not really a question of one of your passwords getting compromised (Unless you don&amp;rsquo;t use the password manager in the way it was intended.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-password-manager&#34;&gt;What is a password manager?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A password manager is similar to an excel spread sheet that you might create yourself to store information with the option of using that spreadsheet to auto generate a complicated passwords and auto-type them for you when you visit your most frequented sites. Password managers help you secure all kinds of information for you and it&amp;rsquo;s designed to keep that information safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-password-manager-should-you-use&#34;&gt;Which password manager should you use?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the 1st part of a 3 part series in protecting yourself from on-line and of-line scams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the 2020 COVID-19 crisis causing many to work from home, it&amp;rsquo;s more important than ever to have a set of tools to deal with threats that come your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this publication, I will help you &lt;strong&gt;identify threats&lt;/strong&gt; so that you can &lt;strong&gt;avoid being deceived&lt;/strong&gt; by malicious calls to action. If your &lt;strong&gt;device has been compromised&lt;/strong&gt; by a scam, its important to &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance3#protecting-yourself-after-the-scam&#34;&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt; how to deal with an attack after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance#the-best-security-is-awareness&#34;&gt;The best security is awareness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance3#updates&#34;&gt;Updates: Spying on the Scammers Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance3#terms&#34;&gt;Terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-best-security-is-awareness&#34;&gt;The best security is awareness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many security measures can help protect your device, but when you become the target, awareness, and education is your best defense. In the last five or ten years, as computer security keeps getting better, many attackers have moved from computer infiltration to targeting &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; through what&amp;rsquo;s called a &amp;ldquo;Social Engineering Attack&amp;rdquo;. A term used to encompass a broad range of malicious activities to extort money from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social engineering attacks happen in one or more steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An attacker does background research on a set of victims in a specific demographic. The goal is to target the most vulnerable people of society, like the elderly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vulnerabilities are discovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armed with the necessary information from step one and two, the attacker uses psychological manipulation in the form of a pointed written message, or phone conversation, to trick you into giving away sensitive information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attackers will likely attempt to trick you with a message that conveys an &lt;strong&gt;illusion of authority&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:illusion-authority&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:illusion-authority&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and a sense of urgency. As an example, you may get a pop-up on your screen that your computer has been compromised, asking you to urgently call a number. You might get an email stating that you are required by law to make contact with a government representative because the IRS didn&amp;rsquo;t receive your tax return, or you might even get a call from the attacker, without any action on your part, claiming to be working for Microsoft and that your computer is unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With any unfamiliar situation, remember to take a deep breath and relax. 99% of communications that attempt to compel you to act with the above tactics are false. These kinds of attacks are most successful when you are in a state of panic. Legitimate business dealings happen on their own with no outside coercion. If at any time you feel forced to perform an action, step back, regroup, and gather information from outside sources. In these circumstances, you never, ever, have to take an immediate action. You always have recourse, but it takes time and patience to find alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most likely indicators of a social engineering attack include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgency&lt;/strong&gt;: A communication that expresses a tremendous sense of urgency, often through fear, intimidation, a crisis, or an important deadline. Attackers can be good at creating convincing messages that appear to come from an authority, or even someone you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;:  A message that creates a sense of &amp;ldquo;No Option&amp;rdquo;. The language indicates that you must act right away, and many interactions will even attempt to get you to bypass or ignore security measures designed to protect you, such as giving out your password to your online bank account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illusion of Authority&lt;/strong&gt;: A author or caller who uses an authoritative tone of voice or a written strong-worded message. This kind of interaction can be framed in many ways, but it works best when an attacker impersonates an agent from a government establishment or a reputable company. The attacker will attempt to use language that sounds authoritative to gain a position of superiority over you. The ultimate goal is to get you to perform an action that, on the surface, appears to benefit you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-psychology-behind-decision-making&#34;&gt;The psychology behind decision making&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to learn a bit about your decision-making process. Recognize your particular temperament when it comes to obstacles and challenges. Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you hold up under pressure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you need to avoid circumstances that lead you to make snap decisions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you practice breathing, and walking away?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemplate on these questions and make a reminder or a mental note for any future dealings with aggressive queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal in the first part of this publication is to attempt to make you aware of some of the common ways in which a scammer operates. When dealing with solicited requests for information, don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to err on the side of caution. It&amp;rsquo;s better to be safe, then sorry. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance2&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; I will discuss techquies of avoiding being a victim of a Scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:illusion-authority&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illusion of authority&lt;/strong&gt; is a term to describe a psychological interaction between two individuals or a group. An author of a letter, email, call or in-person encounter attempts to put themselves in a position of authority by using psychological tactics against you in an attempt to get you acquiesce your freedom of choice.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:illusion-authority&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;avoiding-scams&#34;&gt;Avoiding Scams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-results&#34;&gt;Search Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skipping Ads with an Adblocker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid Ad listings in search results entirely, you can use a reputable Adblocker. Be aware that not all adblockers are created equal, some disguise themselves as adblockers, but instead deliver Ad&amp;rsquo;s to your computer. I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://adblockplus.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Adblock Plus&lt;/a&gt; add-on/extension in Firefox and Google Chrome. It strips out Ad related content from many search engine results. This is the most effective way to protect you from malicious search results. Do not worry about losing any important results. Ad results are only companions to organic search results. If a result shows up in an Ad. I will show up in the search result if it is relevant to the search term. You might run into an occasion where you might need to whitelist a particular site from being blocked, and you can do that through the settings of the adblocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding Ads with Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not want to use an Adblocker you can avoid malicious Ad results by knowing what to look for. The image below shows how Google, Yahoo, and Bing layout their Ad based search results. Headings highlighted in red contain the Ad listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/search-results-ads.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ad Laden Search Result Example 1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search sites like those listed above have a platform for submitting Ads. This allows any &amp;ldquo;Joe&amp;rdquo; to create Ad campaigns that link directly to every day relevant search terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;content-block-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/google-advertising-policies.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/google-advertising-policies.png&#34; alt=&#34;Google&#39;s Advertising Policies Screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has a reporting system for malicious Ads, but by the time Google gets around to correcting the problem, you can be tricked into visiting a malicious site, and if you interact with that site, by then it&amp;rsquo;s usually too late. In some cases, your device can be compromised without any interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;clearfix&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/Browly-scam.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/Browly-scam.png&#34; alt=&#34;Browly Scam Example 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search results that are labeled &amp;ldquo;Ad&amp;rdquo; (See screen-shot above) can be redirected to an alternate site. This means that if you click on a link that you know is reputable, Google inserts itself in the middle and hijacks that link to send you to another location on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately you want to avoid any of the search results that fall under the label &amp;ldquo;Advertisement&amp;rdquo;. Watch out for changes, many search engines change the way Ads are delivered on the search results page. Ad labeled search results usually appear at the top, a list of results can appear under one heading labeled &amp;ldquo;Advertisements&amp;rdquo;, or the label is tagged to each result itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organic search results are ones that are not commercially supported and as such are less likely to have shenanigans attached to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pop-up-warnings-or-error-messages&#34;&gt;Pop-up Warnings or Error Messages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/eugjt.club-scam.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pop-Up Scam&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the scope of normal computer use, legitimate warnings or error messages never include phone numbers. Some specific business applications, like Quickbooks, are the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you receive an error message, or warning on your screen that you cannot get out of, do not interact with it in any way. Instead, you could immediately &lt;strong&gt;shutdown the computer&lt;/strong&gt; by way of the &lt;strong&gt;power button&lt;/strong&gt;. You can power down the computer by &lt;strong&gt;holding the power button down for 5-10 seconds and waiting until the screen goes black&lt;/strong&gt;. Please note that there is a slight chance of data loss when you shutdown your computer in this fashion, but if you cannot get your computer to respond to a shutdown or restart command, or use the Task Manager to kill the task in question, it is my understanding these are the only options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;call-based-scams&#34;&gt;Call-based Scams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/health-center-call-center_759.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Call center scam&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick to &lt;strong&gt;handling inbound call scams&lt;/strong&gt; is to realize that, under most circumstances, obtaining computer support requires that you initiate the contact by your own means. When you receive an unsolicited call from an unknown agent, claiming to be from any legitimate establishment with the intent to offer you any kind of support, hang up. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple. Remember to maintain awareness of your decision-making psychology and don&amp;rsquo;t put yourself into situations that cause you to make snap decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not make outbound calls&lt;/strong&gt; from any error or warning message that appears on any of your devices. Remember the 3 indicators of a social engineering attack: &lt;strong&gt;Urgency&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Illusion of Authority&lt;/strong&gt;. If you need assistance, break away from the task at hand and ask a trusted person instead of blindly following a path that is laid out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;email-based-scams&#34;&gt;Email-based Scams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/scam-email-thunderbird.png&#34; alt=&#34;Microsoft Office365 Email Scam&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making decisions on how to respond to emails that ask you to perform an action can be tricky. There are two categories of inbound emails from any provider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legitimate requests to review information about your accounts or services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illegitimate scams that attempt to portray themselves as legitimate requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you receive an email asking you to perform an action, keep in mind the three basic qualifiers of legitimacy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who&lt;/strong&gt; is the email sender? Are you receiving an email from Microsoft asking you about your email? Do you even have an email with Microsoft? Find out who your mail provider is. If it&amp;rsquo;s not Microsoft, delete the message. If you do have an Email with Microsoft move on to the next step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; is the message asking me to do? Depending on the request, you can sometimes tell that the message is suspect by the way the message is crafted, or by the nature of the request. If the email states that an account you own is on hold because of a billing problem and the message requests that you click on a link to remedy the problem, instead, open up your web browser and visit the site by using &lt;strong&gt;web browser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:web-browser&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:web-browser&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to confirm that problem exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where&lt;/strong&gt; will I land if I act? Without clicking on any links in the email, move your mouse over the link and look at the destination URL. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain a recognizable location, you know you got a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-respond-to-calls-for-help-from-family-friends-or-colleagues&#34;&gt;How to respond to calls for help from family, friends, or colleagues.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, you may encounter a situation, usually by email or social networking, where a contact looks to be someone close to you, who reaches out to you for help in some way. Many scammers steal the identity of a person to target the victims network of contacts. Once the identity has been compromised is some way, the attacker will trying to appeal to individuals in the victims network with a request of good will by crafting a message of help. The message will probably look like a request for money. The contact might mention a travel situation where the contact is in a bind and needs help. Then there might be a link to send that person money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another regular method of attack is to trick an individual from victims network into giving away personal details, like bank account information, or any site where your credit card is stored by convincing the target to click on a link that takes the victim to a page that looks like a legitimate website, but instead is a malicious site used to steal account credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to deal with these situations is to try to reach out using outside methods. Call the contact and verify via voice that the message is legit. If you cant reach the person, call or text a close friend and see if they know anything about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal in this part of the series was to show you some ways in which a scammer might trick you into giving away personally identifying information with some ways you can avoid this. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance3&#34;&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt; I will discuss ways to protect yourself after you have become a victim of a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is 3rd part of a 3 part series in protecting yourself from on-line and of-line scams. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance2&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; I discussed some ways you can avoid scams before you become a victum. In this part of the series I will outline some ways to handle yourself after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance#the-best-security-is-awareness&#34;&gt;The best security is awareness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance3/#conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance3#updates&#34;&gt;Updates: Spying on the Scammers Video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance3#terms&#34;&gt;Terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;protecting-yourself-after-the-scam&#34;&gt;Protecting yourself after the Scam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have already been a victim of an scam. The first thing to do is to stop the interaction with the attacker. If you have given the attacker access to your technology, shutdown the device and contact me for free evaluation. In most cases its safer to &lt;strong&gt;factory restore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:factory-restore&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:factory-restore&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the device than to try and target the intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;protect-your-on-line-accounts&#34;&gt;Protect your on-line accounts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change your passwords for important online accounts like your social networking, email and finical services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a strong passwords, and do not use the same password for all of your important online accounts. Better yet, get to know and use a password manager. A &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/recommendations/recommendation-password-managers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;password manager&lt;/a&gt; will help you create complicated passwords without having to remember them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find that one or more of your accounts are repeatedly getting hacked, and your not sure where the breach is, one area that often gets overlooked is smart phone security. To find out more about security your smartphone, read my &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-smartphone-protection&#34;&gt;Protecting Your Smartphone From Being Hacked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; which delves into advanced &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-smartphone-protection#2-factor-authentication&#34;&gt;2 factor authentication methods&lt;/a&gt;. Many online services still use the insecure smartphone text based method, which is really a liability instead of a strength. If your thinking about purchasing an identity theft protection service, read my publication &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-id-theft-what-why/&#34;&gt;What is Identity Theft Protection, and do you need it?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;protect-your-financial-information&#34;&gt;Protect your financial information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact your financial institutions and let them know you have been a victim of a scam. Get your credit cards reissued&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal in this publication was to attempt to make you aware of some of the common ways in which a scammer operates, but there may be other methods that are outside of its scope. When dealing with solicited requests for information, don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to err on the side of caution. It&amp;rsquo;s better to be safe, then sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about this publication, or you would like help with your computer&amp;rsquo;s security, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#contact&#34;&gt;contact&lt;/a&gt; me. I can assess your protection, and offer suggestions to improve your online safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;updates&#34;&gt;Updates&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2020/04/24**: There is a very interesting video called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le71yVPh4uk&amp;amp;feature=emb_title&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spying on the Scammers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;  that was release on Youtube in March of 2020 detailing how these scamming operations run and outlines some of the tactics they use. For anyone that wants to avoid the headache and financial loss of becoming a victim of a phone scam (or any scam for that matter), I strongly advise watching this 4 part series. Knowing how these operations run creates awareness that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn:factory-restore&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factory Restore&lt;/strong&gt; is a method to restore the device to its factory state when you first purchase the device. This can assure that any actions that were performed on your device are erased.

      <title>Restoring your digital life from backup after a disaster</title>
      <link>http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-restoring-life-backup-disaster/</link>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Learn why solely backing up your data isn&amp;rsquo;t always enough to recover from a disaster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this publication, you will learn about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-disaster-recovery-backup-and-why-should-i-care&#34;&gt;What is disaster recovery backup, and why should I care?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#how-a-little-planning-can-drive-a-successful-disaster-recovery&#34;&gt;How a little planning can drive a successful disaster recovery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#why-waiting-for-a-disaster-to-happen-before-you-plan-is-a-bad-idea&#34;&gt;Why waiting for a disaster to happen before you plan is a bad idea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#terms&#34;&gt;Understanding technology terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing the difference between backup and disaster recovery, understanding key technology terms, and evaluating software along with storage options can help you develop an effective plan for avoiding the consequences of data loss and downtime after a catastrophe strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-disaster-recovery-backup-and-why-should-i-care&#34;&gt;What is disaster recovery backup, and why should I care?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backup&lt;/strong&gt; is the process of making an extra copy (or multiple copies) of data. You might need to restore data from a backup if you accidentally delete a file, or folder, or when a file, or folder becomes corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaster Recovery&lt;/strong&gt; is having all tools in place to recover from a loss of data. Do you just need to recover one file, a set of files, or your entire computer? If your entire computer needs to be recovered, will you lose anything recently saved? How do you perform a full recovery of your computer? Knowing the answers to these questions is essential to your recovery plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disaster Recovery Backup&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, refers to the plan and processes for quickly reestablishing access to your data after a catastrophe. If your computer, or applications fail catastrophically, become lost, or stolen, your &lt;strong&gt;Desktop environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:desktop-env&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:desktop-env&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; can be restored to a previous working condition, minimizing downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am prepared for the worst, but hope for the best.” - Benjamin Disraeli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/digital-life/storage-options.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Backup storage options photo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-the-strengths-and-weaknesses-of-different-storage-options-and-locations&#34;&gt;What are the strengths and weaknesses of different storage options and locations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A backup and a disaster recovery backup are similar in that they both need a location to store a copy of the data that is needed for a restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;strong&gt;Cloud Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:cloud-storage&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:cloud-storage&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; scenario, data is stored outside the home, or small office. This off-site location protects your data from being destroyed by a tragedy, like a fire, or loss from a theft of your equipment. The speed and reliability of the &lt;strong&gt;Cloud Backup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:cloud-backup&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:cloud-backup&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; service, as well as the internet connection to your home, or office, is a factor in determining the length of time needed for a data restoration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:NetworkStorage&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:NetworkStorage&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or a &lt;strong&gt;Network Attached Storage Device (NAS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:NetworkStorage&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:NetworkStorage&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are &lt;strong&gt;storage locations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:storage-location&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:storage-location&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that give you Cloud like storage in your home. Network Storage gives you the ability to store files onto it from any device in your home that is connected to your home, or business network. The speed in which data can be transferred to, and from a NAS is largely dependent on the kind of hardware (&lt;strong&gt;Network Router&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:router&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:router&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;WiFi Access Point&lt;/strong&gt;[^-wifi-access-point], &lt;strong&gt;Network Switch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:network-switch&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:network-switch&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Network Cabling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:network-cabling&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:network-cabling&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) you have, and the connection between the NAS and your devices (Wired or Wireless). In my experience, Network Storage Devices are less susceptible to physical connection problems and damage due to the fact that they are rarely moved from their physical location. Wired connections are typically faster than Wireless connections. There are many types of Wired and Wireless connections. Having the latest technology insures that you will have the fastest transfer speeds between two or more devices. Transfer speeds between devices is really important. The less time it takes for data to transfer to and from devices the less likely a problem will occur in the transfer, or backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of using a &lt;strong&gt;Local Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:local-storage&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:local-storage&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; device over Cloud or Network storage is speed, convenience, and ease of use. But moving the storage device around, regularly disconnecting/reconnect it, often in situations that require it, like bringing a laptop with you on the go, may eventually cause damage to, or cause a connection problem with the storage device. In many cases, when a connection problem shows up, the backup software cannot do its job, and you may not know that there is a problem until it&amp;rsquo;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, drawbacks of each technology cannot be avoided. It’s best to choose two, or more storage options that work best for your needs and make redundancy your friend. If one storage device, or location fails, have another, and another. Three &lt;strong&gt;storage locations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:storage-location&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:storage-location&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are optimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/digital-life/disaster-recovery-choice.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;planning to recovery your digital life&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-a-little-planning-can-drive-a-successful-disaster-recovery&#34;&gt;How a little planning can drive a successful disaster recovery&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;identifying-the-best-technologies-for-achieving-your-backup-and-disaster-recovery-goals-for-home-and-small-businesses&#34;&gt;Identifying the best technologies for achieving your backup and disaster recovery goals for home and small businesses&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing to understand first is what kind of computer user you are: &lt;strong&gt;Basic&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Intermediate&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Advanced&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just do email and docs..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;Basic&lt;/strong&gt; user you might not need much of a backup solution. The trick is to find out what you do with your device most of the time, and see if you actually need a backup solution. If you view your mail online using Gmail, Yahoo Mail, or Microsoft (Hotmail,or Outlook Mail) you are agreeing to let that provider store your mail for you. Be aware that just having a Cloud based Email provider store your Email for you may not shield you from mail loss. Even using an Email application like Outlook, or Thunderbird, your mail is stored on the mail server (Not on your device. It might be important to you to archive mail to some other location within your possession. Mail applications usually have archiving functionality which allows you to store a copy of your mail on your device’s storage drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documents are usually stored on your device’s storage drive unless you are using a Cloud Storage service. If you do not use a Cloud Storage service like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dropbox.com/&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/drive/&#34;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/a&gt;, then your documents are stored on your device’s storage drive. Having a backup solution safeguards that data in case you lose your device, or it becomes damaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know enough just to get myself into trouble…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;strong&gt;Intermediate&lt;/strong&gt; user, you probably use your device professionally, or for education purposes and you work with more than just mail and documents. You might also save files like music, pictures, and videos. You may use non-standard applications like Turbotax, or Quickbooks. In a case like this, regular automatic backups using &lt;strong&gt;backup software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:backup-software&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:backup-software&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; might be preferable to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know my stuff, but I don&amp;rsquo;t really do backup that well…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;strong&gt;Advanced&lt;/strong&gt; user, the way you use your device, the placement of everything stored on the device, and the programs you use are all vital to your everyday activities. If you  lost access to your device for too long, it would probably cause a problem for you. In a case like this, using &lt;strong&gt;Disaster Recovery Backup software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:backup-software&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:backup-software&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to backup a full copy of your &lt;strong&gt;system drive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:system-drive&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:system-drive&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; might be preferable to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-kind-of-backup-software-do-i-need&#34;&gt;What kind of backup software do I need?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a host of backup software solutions on the market. For &lt;strong&gt;local backups&lt;/strong&gt;, Windows 10 comes with its own backup solution called &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/b8/2012/07/10/protecting-user-files-with-file-history/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;File History&lt;/a&gt;. If you are a &lt;strong&gt;Basic&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Intermediate&lt;/strong&gt; user this might work for you. You would need to purchase an external hard drive and set up File History to perform regular backups of your important &lt;strong&gt;storage locations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:storage-location&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:storage-location&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. If you find that you require more control over the way your data is backed up than what File History offers, commercial third party products such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.easeus.com/backup-software/tb-enterprise.html?ad&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMImPS1-ea65gIVth6tBh0thgM9EAAYAiAAEgKfgvD_BwE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EaseUS ToDo Backup&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.paragon-software.com/backup-recovery/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Paragon Backup and Recovery&lt;/a&gt; can offer more options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;Intermediate&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Advanced&lt;/strong&gt; users, who cannot be without access to their programs and data for too long, and want to minimize the time in recovering from a disaster, I recommend Disaster Recovery Backup software like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Macirum Reflect&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.acronis.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Acronis True Image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-waiting-for-a-disaster-to-happen-before-you-plan-is-a-bad-idea&#34;&gt;Why waiting for a disaster to happen before you plan is a bad idea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many things can happen in the process of using your device. The place where you store your device could be involved in a catastrophe, your device could be stolen, your device’s internal storage drive could fail, you could accidentally delete a file, or a file could become corrupted in the process of using your device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t wait until it’s too late to devise a plan to protect your data. Protecting your data is like having insurance, you don&amp;rsquo;t know when, or if, you will need it, but when you do, boy can it be a lifesaver.
Having a plan also builds confidence, so when your data becomes inaccessible, you have actions you can take to restore your access. Just having a plan alone can help you improve your knowledge about what you know, and don’t know about your device and your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a disaster recovery solution in place you can protect yourself from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downtime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:downtime&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:downtime&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, by avoiding lengthy repairs to your device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High repair, or data recovery costs when a device fails catastrophically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:malware&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:malware&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;ransomeware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:ransomeware&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:ransomeware&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; infections by being able to restore from a previous backup.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>What is Identity Theft Protection, and do you need it?</title>
      <link>http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-id-theft-what-why/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 09 Nov 2019 12:33:54 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It is relatively easy from the standpoint of a thief to impersonate your online identity and assume your financial standing. Using your identity, a thief can open up a line of credit under your name and go on a shopping spree making you assume all of the responsibility until you rectify the problem. As more and more of our personal information gets warehoused online, protecting information against theft is a continuing challenge on both sides of the fence, customers and financial institutions alike. Just recently, an IRS employee stole $70,000 from the government using identities of a few taxpayers and went on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://qz.com/1723855/an-irs-employee-stole-identities-went-on-spending-spree/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2-year long spending spree&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottrlarson.com/updates/update-smartphone-protection/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;online security measures&lt;/a&gt; now exist that make it very difficult to assume a person&amp;rsquo;s digital identity, but each institution that hosts online services to their customers needs to implement it. I touch on this at the end of this article. On the one hand, they want to, and do respond to threats after the fact pretty well. On the other hand, real security is about  preventing attacks in the first place.  Most well established financial institutions are large behemoths and do not like change. In most cases many will most likely play the “wait and see” game to assess which of these security measures becomes a standard. While outdated security implementations exist (Which become weak points of attack over time), thieves are taking advantage of the situation while they can. This is where Identity Theft Protection (ITP) Services come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/updates/identity-protection-services/identity-theft-protection-services.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Identity Theft Protection Services Photo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, ITP services like Lifelock seem to act as an intermediary that aims to preemptively protect against theft of personal information, and respond to suspicious activity at the source, usually a bank or financial institution. Personal information like your name, address, mobile number, social security number, and birth date can be stored with these third parties. The information is used by financial institutions to provide you with corresponding services. This is why these institutions are often under attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At $120 a year, ITP Services use these online systems (already accessible to the public) and further automate them to provide you with regular updates under one account controlled by the ITP service. The idea is that the ITP service acts on your behalf, interacting with your bank, or financial institution, to correct personal information inaccuracies, or act on an instance of fraud activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that in the world of information security, there are business minded people that use fear to profit on the uninformed, and there are security minded people who try to educate. I definitely fall into the latter camp. I would rather people become better informed on how to protect their information, than to support a system that puts many of its customers in the passenger seat of information security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, information security can be complex, especially if you have multiple accounts with multiple financial institutions. Due to your financial solvency, if you are finding that your information is constantly being compromised, or that you might be a good target for an attacker, it might be worth it for you to pay an ITP service to help you protect your identity. The drawback is that you have to trust another third party (and its employees) with all of your personal identifying information. This could be another angle of attack for some, but if you have already become accustomed to giving out your personal information to any service that asks for it, without question, or you are required to, then it might benefit you to have one more link in the chain work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-strong-points-of-itp-services&#34;&gt;The Strong Points of ITP Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITP services attempt to be proactive by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flagging all three credit bureaus with a fraud alert on a regular basis. This forces financial institutions to contact you personally before a line of credit gets opened in your name. This makes it harder for criminals to impersonate you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a secondary benefit to the fraud alerts, these services may also collate important about changes to your personal information from various sources in an account that you can view at-a-glance. Focusing on your current credit report, changes to your stored contact information, and any data-mining campaigns that you have been opted into. Thus, making it easier to opt-out of any programs you have been opted into with or without your knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-weak-points-of-itp-services&#34;&gt;The Weak Points of ITP Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the most part, ITP services seem slow to respond to real-time fraud activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to ITP services’ dependence on outside automated systems, the information the service gathers can often contain inaccurate data. This requires a manual review by you, or the ITP service&amp;rsquo;s own staff, increasing the length of time it takes to act on a discrepancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research has shown, based on the experience of customers that have tried and reviewed these services, that ITP services do not offer much beyond what financial services already offer except to babysit your accounts for you, however slowly. You can protect yourself by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2FA (two-factor authentication)&lt;/a&gt; paired with an authenticator app using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TOTP (Time-based One-time Password)&lt;/a&gt; and/or a USB/NFC device that uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;U2F (Universal 2nd Factor)&lt;/a&gt; for sites that support it wherever possible. Replace text based two-factor authentication with the above as soon as you can, and when you do disable text based two-factor on your account. If your smartphone gets compromised, the text-messaging based two-factor authentication can be easily circumvented, or redirected to an attackers mobile by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;social engineering&lt;/a&gt; your mobile provider to get them to swap your mobile account to another sim card. You can read more about how to secure your mobile phone and online accounts in my article &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottrlarson.com/updates/update-smartphone-protection/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Protecting Your Smartphone From Being Hacked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a web browser with some kind of scripting protection. I use Firefox with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Noscript Addon&lt;/a&gt;, but there is a Chrome &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;noscript extension&lt;/a&gt; as well now. This prevents sites from using aggressive forms of tracking techniques to steal information (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clickjacking&lt;/a&gt;). These add-ons/extensions help prevent your computer from leaking information about you, but they might also change your browsing experience in such a way that might prevent you from accessing certain areas of specific websites. Depending the amount of scripting a site uses, many of these types of sites do not react well when the scripting becomes disabled.  In these cases having scripting protection depends on your ability to white-list sites that you know are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stopdatamining.me/opt-out-list/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Opting out of data mining practices with the major data brokers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have been victim of identity theft already, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs#place&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Freeze your credit report&lt;/a&gt; If you have been a victim of ID theft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.identitytheft.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;File a ID theft report with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being aware of exactly what, or how much information about you is online, and closing out, or making an effort to remove information you do not want online. If you want to see how much of your personal info is available online, you can pay a site such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://radaris.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Radaris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.advancedbackgroundchecks.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Advanced Background Checks&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.publicrecordsnow.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Public Records Now&lt;/a&gt; to search out what is available about you. Please note these sites are not exactly legal and they may disappear and reappear under different names, at will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing a mindset of data protection at all times. Always resist attempts to put your information in a computer system. Don&amp;rsquo;t let your dentist have your SSN without a fight. Don&amp;rsquo;t let them have your real birthday without asking why they need it and &lt;strong&gt;asking if it&amp;rsquo;s required&lt;/strong&gt;, or more importantly: &amp;ldquo;By what authority are you obligating me to provide YOU with this information?&amp;rdquo; Obviously this is going to slow down your intake process and you might get denied service by some providers. If a service requires too much personally identifiable information from you that can be used in a way to steal your identity, is it really worth it to use that service?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activating a fraud alert by contacting (by phone, or online, one of the major credit bureaus: (No need to contact all three, as they are required to communicate fraud alerts with each other. Remember to renew the fraud alert every 90 days.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alerts.equifax.com/AutoFraud_Online/jsp/fraudAlert.jsp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Equifax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.experian.com/fraud/center.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Experian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transunion.com/fraud-alerts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TransUnion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three major credit bureaus are required to provide you with a free credit report once a year, apply for a report using the respective bureaus websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartphones are much more than simple tools to make calls and take pictures. They have become our personal assistants. Storing everything about us. On the one hand, using a smartphone for our day to day living makes life much more convenient. On the other hand, storing all that info about our life on one device that we take with us on the go, opens us up to data theft. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of, its important for our society to be open. But its also good to be cautious.  When a unwanted stranger gets ahold of your smartphone, or is able to siphon out your credit card information to make purchases in your name, it effects the trusted systems we have come to rely on. You can do something about that, you can protect yourself, and in the process, make our technology safer to rely on.  Personal details about you, like your name, address, and phone number are like children, they become attached to your identity for a long, long time. If a shady character gains access to your mobile account or smartphone, they can gain access to other areas of your life as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your bank asks you for your mobile phone number, to text you a code to view your dollars online, what happens if that message gets diverted? If some pilferer has a reason to do you in, your mobile account information can be a gateway for a smash and grab. One way this theft is perpetrated on you is through what&amp;rsquo;s called a &amp;ldquo;Sim Card Swap&amp;rdquo;. (No, this is not related to your Sim Game Character) If this looser gains access to your smartphone, details about you become a weapon. Then it becomes possible to attack your mobile carrier, and get them to transfer your mobile account to a new owner, a smartphone account thief. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.issms2fasecure.com/assets/sim_swaps-01-10-2020.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Princeton study&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 found that all the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.engadget.com/2020/01/12/princeton-study-sim-swap/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;five major US mobile phone carriers are vulnerable to SIM-swapping tactics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a assessment of a smartphone security breach, I spoke to a identity theft victim. The victim wanted to know if it was possible to gain access to a email account that was taken over by an identity thief. One night, over a period of a few hours, the victim had lost access to a smartphone. Later on, it turned up, but something strange started happening. Someone was attempting to impersonate the victim by posting messages to the victim&amp;rsquo;s Facebook account. The messages were self-damaging to the victims character. It turned out that the likely culprit was another party in a court case the victim was connected to. It&amp;rsquo;s a good chance the other party wanted to convince the court to question the victims character by making discrediting remarks through the victims online presence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-factor-authentication&#34;&gt;2-Factor Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coindesk.com/att-fails-to-win-dismissal-in-24-million-crypto-sim-swap-lawsuit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AT&amp;amp;T lost a $24 million lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, many in the online services industry started questioning the use of text messaging for account access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartphones are too easy to hack. Setup alternate 2-factor methods of authentication like the ones below and avoid text-messaging methods altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/updates/smartphone-protection/titan-security-keys.png&#34; alt=&#34;Google&#39;s Titian Security Keys&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two new technologies were release early this year to combat theses kinds of attacks, under the umbrella of what&amp;rsquo;s called 2-factor authentication: A Smartphone app called an &amp;ldquo;Authenticator App&amp;rdquo;, and a USB/Bluetooth flash-drive called a Security Key. The Smartphone app works by installing a authenticator app on your smart-phone. A few developers have release authenticator apps that you can find in your app store: &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;amp;hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Authenticator App&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Authenticator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://freeotp.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;FreeOTP&lt;/a&gt;. The USB/Bluetooth Security Key works by plugging in a flash-drive looking device into the USB port of your desktop, or laptop. Other security keys on the market work by pairing your smartphone to a bluetooth device, and using it to log-in to your accounts by pressing a button. These devices work in conjunction with your password, so if a thief gains access to it, they will need your password as well. These tools work well if a attacker gains access to you smartphone or mobile account. Those text message codes wont help the thief if the security key is not present for the secondary authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/updates/smartphone-protection/google-security-key-prompt.png&#34; alt=&#34;Google&#39;s Titian Security Keys&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind both of these technologies are twins in terms of how they protect your identity, so you do not get locked out of your account, if your forget one of the two. Not all Security Key packages offer the same choices, so it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235173/the-best-hardware-security-keys-yubico-titan-key-u2f&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;look at the options&lt;/a&gt; each package provides, to be sure the key you purchase is going to work with your particular setup. If you need help deciding, I can help you evaluate your options with a &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#contact&#34;&gt;free 20 minute consultation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Securing your smartphone is a insurance policy. You might never get attacked, but if you do, having a security key or an authenticator app in addition to you single password sign-on is a smart idea. Because of your password gets changed by an attacker you wont have much recourse to recover your account and you might have to spent a lot of time changing your passwords and setting up a new mobile account. As we put more and more of our life on-line, protecting your identity is going to increasingly become an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-protect-your-smartphone-from-being-attacked&#34;&gt;How to protect your Smartphone from being attacked:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-don-t-break-up-with-your-smartphone&#34;&gt;1. Don’t break-up with your smartphone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t walk away from your Smartphone and leave it unattended. If you plan on upgrading to a new smartphone, or you just want to leave the smartphone high-life behind, check out my &lt;a href=&#34;#other-tips&#34;&gt;other tips&lt;/a&gt; on recycling your smartphone. If you do plan on continuing the high-life however, configure your smartphone to lock automatically after five minutes, or less. Don&amp;rsquo;t lend your smartphone to friends, family, or your cat. I know you trust your cat, but lending your smartphone out for even a few minutes, or hours adds to that &amp;ldquo;I lost something&amp;rdquo; feeling. No person is as careful with your stuff, as you are. If you need to demo a photo, video, or otherwise, make your smartphone a physical extension of your arm. I&amp;rsquo;m totally not kidding here, well mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-mix-those-passwords-up&#34;&gt;2. Mix those passwords up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a unique password, or PIN for your smartphone, don&amp;rsquo;t be a copycat. And make sure it&amp;rsquo;s one that you do not use anywhere else. Or better yet if you have a lot of password dementia going on in your life, consider hiring a manager, well I really mean getting a application called a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottrlarson.com/recommendations/recommendation-password-managers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Password Manager&lt;/a&gt;. Password Manager&amp;rsquo;s help minimize password dementia. These apps can generate complex passwords that you do not have to remember. I know, I know it sounds complicated. But think of a password manager as a typing assistant. It can type those pesky passwords of you. Many can type and remember passwords for you on your PC, Desktop, or mobile device. &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#contact&#34;&gt;Contact me&lt;/a&gt; if you need help choosing, or setting up one of these baby&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-maintain-your-up-to-date-ness&#34;&gt;3. Maintain your up-to-date-ness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mobile device is like your car. It only runs well when you keep it fine-tuned. Mobile OS&amp;rsquo;s and applications are updated on a regular basis. Ensure that you follow though with those updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-public-hotspots-are-public&#34;&gt;4. Public hotspots are public&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be smart about how you use a unprotected network like a hotspot. It&amp;rsquo;s great for checking news, maybe not so great for logging into your bank. Unless you have a secondary way to authenticate using a authenticator app, or Security Key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-stick-to-the-tried-and-true&#34;&gt;5. Stick to the tried and true&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Jailbreak you smartphone, or let a friend convince that you need some rogue app that is not part of your app store.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;panel-group&#34; id=&#34;accordion&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;panel panel-default&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div style=&#34;border: none; padding-left:0; padding-top: 0;&#34; class=&#34;panel-heading&#34;&gt;
      &lt;h3 class=&#34;&#34;&gt;
        &lt;a data-toggle=&#34;collapse&#34; data-parent=&#34;#accordion&#34; href=&#34;#collapse-list-othersmartphoneprotection&#34;&gt;6. Other Smartphone protection tips&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;collapse-list-othersmartphoneprotection&#34; class=&#34;panel-collapse collapse&#34;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&#34;panel-body&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not modify the smartphone’s security settings&lt;/strong&gt;: Check what permissions are required before installing any apps, and be careful that access to sensitive information is not being granted if it&amp;rsquo;s not necessary for the app in question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply encryption&lt;/strong&gt; to the internal memory card and – if possible – to any sensitive data held; If you back-up your device to another location, make sure that backup is encrypted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure ‘Bluetooth’ is switched off if not required.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think before clicking&lt;/strong&gt; on web links, or attachments in emails, or text messages – if you are not sure who the message is coming from, or the message is coming from someone you know that would never send you that kind of information, or that person would never make this kind of contact with you, ignore the message and delete it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure Erase that Old Device&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensure that the smartphone is securely recycled, donated or disposed of – e.g. erase all data first, reset it to the factory settings; remove the SIM card.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report a lost or stolen phone ASAP&lt;/strong&gt;: If the smartphone is lost or stolen, report it  as soon as possible to your mobile provider.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set a PIN on your SIM card&lt;/strong&gt;: Most smartphones have the ability to set a PIN code on the SIM card itself. If your SIM card, or smartphone gets compromised, the attacker will be required to enter a PIN code to unlock the capabilities of the SIM card, unless the smartphone is powered on and unlocked at the time it has been compromised. (Shutting down or restarting your smartphone will require you to enter in this PIN in addition to whatever password you have setup on the smartphone itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the best security (Smartphone or otherwise) is awareness. Being aware of what you know (and don&amp;rsquo;t know) about your technology is one step for man, and one giant leap for mankind. Have some peace of mind about where you stand with security. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to proceed on any of these areas, &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/#contact&#34;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; and I can help you formulate a master plan. My goal is to is to be that troubleshooter for you, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to figure things thing&amp;rsquo;s out yourself..&lt;/p&gt;
