### The Showdown

If you haven\'t already received the free upgrade notification on your
computer about Windows 10, Microsoft says its due to be released around
July or August. Its just been over two years since the release of
Windows 8, a very short release cycle considering Microsoft\'s previous
3-4 year release cycle, primarily due to Microsoft\'s market share loss
in the mobile device market. Reports show that Windows 8 is currently
running on less that 15% of PC\'s, and less than 2.8% of mobile devices.
Windows 8 was Microsoft\'s first entry into the mobile market with the
introduction of the touch based tablet interface that was designed to
combine both the mobile and desktop graphic interface into one
integrated experience.

In my humble experience the Windows 8 tablet design didn\'t really work
particularly well on PC and Laptop screens. PC\'s and Laptops now
include a touch screen, but I don't think touch screens work that well in
heavy work load environments. Desktops are primarily for productivity,
you can get more done with a mouse and keyboard than you can on touch
screen.

### The War

The biggest frustration for me was not that it was necessarily a mobile
experience designed for the desktop, but that I didn\'t quite know which
world I was really living in: Was it a PC Desktop experience? Was it a
mobile experience? Was it both? In Windows 8, Microsoft changed the
Windows Start Menu into a touch display with panels for what I though
would be all of my desktop shortcuts. That cold reasoning went out of
the window when I first attempted to open the Internet Explorer browser.
Instead of the IE Window I was used to seeing, I was instead forcibly
brought into the world of full screen Metro applications designed for
tablet displays that couldn\'t be resized. The original user desktop
interface still existed, thankfully. For me since I don\'t use Windows
Mobile devices I ended up hiding those features and sticking with
desktop applications.

### The Questions

For this article I am testing the preview release of Windows 10. Windows
10 Preview is not a finished product by any means, so any features and
limitations that I write about are subject to change when Windows 10 is
released around the 29th. My testing has been ongoing for a couple of
weeks since it\'s release. So, how does Windows 10 Preview stack up to
Windows 8? Read on to see why I think Windows 10 an big improvement.

### The Answers

Some big improvements have been made to strengthen the usability of
Windows 10 for desktop users. Navigating and using your desktop just
became a lot simpler.

**The Start Menu**

:::
:::

-   Replacing the touch screen in Windows 8, is the return of the Start
    Menu. It\'s really a combination of the Windows 7 Start Menu with a
    tablet panel that can be used to pin apps to. The best part about
    the new Start Menu is that doesn\'t interfere with your main
    shortcuts and recent applications list menu.

**Additional Changes**

-   You can pin your most recent applications to the tablet display just
    like you did in Windows 8.

-   Your most recent applications show up in a list just like they did
    in Windows 7.

:::
:::

-   Clicking on \'All Programs\' opens up a navigation panel with a
    scrollable list of applications sorted alphabetically in large
    lettering making applications easier to find.

-   Power Options: Restart, Shutdown and Hibernate/Standby have returned
    as well, right above \'All Apps\'.

-   Logging off is now located under your Windows account name at the
    top of the Start Menu: You can change your account settings, lock
    the computer, or sign into a different account by left clicking on
    your account name.

-   With a right click on your mouse the Start Button gives you a nice
    context menu with many settings to configure Windows. This change
    improves the accessibility to the back end features of Windows. This
    is a great feature for solution providers.

**Interface Improvements**

In Windows 10, Moving application windows around, and stacking them have
become much more intuitive. It\'s easier to set two windows side by
side. By dragging one of your application windows to the right or left,
it snaps in place like Windows 7. Now in addition to the previous
functionality, a preview of your other open Windows appears in the
remaining space. If you click on one of those windows it snaps in place
on the opposite side giving you a split screen view.

Microsoft introduced a nice feature for professionals that helps to
organize work loads into separate virtual desktop areas. Its called the
Task View.

With Task View, you can separate applications into specific virtual
desktops and then switch between those VD\'s using the Task View Button.
For example, you can have one VD with graphic editing applications, and
on another VD with video editing applications.

With a few applications open you can see how this works. Check to see if
the \'Taks View\' Button [![Task View Icon
Image](http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Icon-TaskView.png)]{.win10icon}
is enabled by \'Right\' clicking your mouse on an empty part of the
Taskbar. [ [![Windows 10 Taskbar Options Context Menu

Now, by clicking on the \'Task View\' button [![Task View Icon

on the task bar near the \'Windows Search Field\' a preview of all your
open applications appear along with a desktop preview at the bottom. By
clicking on the \'New Desktop\' button [ ![New Desktop Icon

you can add a new virtual desktop to this view.

:::
:::

At the bottom you should now see two desktop preview icons. You can then
drag some windows from the preview into one of those desktops. Then, to
switch between the two you can click on one of the desktop previews at
the bottom. When you return to your Desktop, you can select an
application on your task bar that you previously moved to a virtual
desktop, and your desktop screen will scroll to the VD with those
applications that you dropped into it. Its designed to prevent clutter
and organize your different work loads more efficiently.

**Notification Sidebar**

:::
:::

In Windows 7, notification bubbles that popped up on the system tray
tended to get in the way, and clicking on one of the bubbles opened a
separate notification window backgrounding your current application that
was previously in focus. In Windows 10 notifications have been moved
into a full fledged notification sidebar that is part of the main
desktop interface. Any time you commit a change to a file, or a
notification needs to update you about an operation a window scrolls in
from the right side letting you know what happened. You can also bring
up the notification sidebar without it interfering with your work to
turn features on and off. You can change your touch screen/display
settings, along with your PC\'s power and network options right from
this Notification Sidebar.

**Search Tools**

:::
:::

The Windows Search tool has changed significantly, it\'s become part of
the Start Menu similar to the old Google Desktop Search that was
discontinued. The built-in search tool is a bit more interactive than
Google\'s Desktop Search. You can minimize the size of it by right
clicking on the Task Bar (Not on any Pinned App) highlighting Search and
choosing: \'Icon\', or \'Disabled\' if you don\'t plan on using it. [

]{.win10screenshotback}

Searching for and Navigating search results and apps appear to be
improved quite a bit. I dont particularily like web results mixed in
with my local desktop search results and I couldnt find a way to remove
this entirely as of yet. It will be interesting to see if and how this
will be used.

**Cortana**

::: {.win10filmfeed}
::: {.win10filmstrip}
[![Windows 10 Desktop Cortana Welcome

:::
:::

Microsoft introduced Cortana, a new digital assistant tool that
retrieves information you need now or might want in the future via text,
or voice as you make requests for information. You can using it for
planning trips, give you news updates about a particular subject, or
have it remind you about a upcoming meeting. The voice recognition
feature can help you dictate letters or emails and make them easy to
send. It also has some features that listens to conversations so that it
can help you plan out your life.

**Microsoft Edge**

Internet Explorer 11 is still part of Windows 10 so I don\'t know if
they plan to replacing it in the future. Edge is Microsoft\'s new
interactive web browser for searching the net making web pages more
interactive. Edge has been redesigned with a new rendering engine
improving interactive display performance on cutting edge hardware. The
interactive tools allow you to take notes right onto web pages and share
these interactive web pages with others. As you use Edge its suppose to
learn what\'s important to you and makes that content easier to access.
Right now Edge appears to be very unstable and I was unable to do an
real testing with it. We will have to wait and see how well it works
when Windows 10 is released.

### The Blue

There is a rumor that this will be the last release of a retail product
and that Microsoft is moving in the direction of selling features as a
service. You can see this move with the release of the office in the
cloud service, Office365. It\'s not entirely clear if Microsoft is going
to be heading in that direction with Windows 10. I do think Microsoft is
in a better position to sell features that people need in the Windows
Store that tie themselves into Windows.

### The Good

-   Improved Interface: The Start Menu combines the best of both Windows
    7 and Windows 8 making it easier to access apps and settings.
    Explorer Icons and Previews help you find the files you are looking
    for most.

-   Improved search features right from the Task Bar/Start Menu.

-   Sleeker design making applications more space efficient.

-   Improved reporting tools such as the new Notification Sidebar that
    helps you understand whats going on and improves the ability to
    change settings.

### The Bad

-   Windows 10 is going to require better hardware, It does not run well
    on older hardware prior to 2012.

-   Bugs in the system make certain features unstable. Microsoft Edge
    itself was very buggy, but that should change with time.

:::
:::

-   In the Preview version\'s terms of service which has not yet been
    released to the public, Microsoft says it plans on collecting
    samples of certain information, it should be noted that all of these
    features have serious implications for abuse. At the moment the
    privacy settings for speech recognition and text is pretty flexible
    if you need to turn these features off, but that could be subject to
    change at any time. Microsoft terms of service details how this
    information will be used:

    -   Cortana\'s speech recognition will collect voice samples when
        you ask it questions and, it was mentioned that it would collect
        voice samples, and in some cases voice conversations.

    -   When you input text, handwritten notices or ink comments,
        Microsoft may collect samples of your input to improve these
        features.

    -   When you open a file, Microsoft may collect information about
        the file, the application used to open the file, and the
        performance impact of opening a file; to improve future
        implementations.

### The Ugly

-   In Windows 10, the choices for when, and how Automatic Updates are
    installed has been someone simplified. When windows updates are
    ready to be downloaded and installed, you have two choices, Install
    or Postpone. If you chose install, updates are downloaded and
    installed immediately, along with drivers as well as system updates.
    Automatic driver updates is a cause for concern. For example, When I
    installed Windows 10 on my laptop, it updated my mouse driver to the
    latest version. The driver not being stable caused my system to
    crash every time I tried to use the mouse. To resolve the problem, I
    had to roll back the driver to the previous version. That change was
    only temporary though until another update happened, re-downloading
    and installing the same faulty driver that effected my laptop
    previously. Automatic driver updates is a nightmare waiting to
    happen. There are too many variables that can cause instability in
    the operation of functioning drivers. My guess is that automatic
    driver updates might change on release, or Windows Users will have
    to deal with any faulty driver updates as they happen. I will
    release a Windows 10 review update with any changes when Windows 10
    is fully released on the 29th of July.

### The Reasons

If you are purchasing a new computer I would say its worth giving it a
try since the system comes prepackaged with the right drivers, but at
this point I wouldn\'t recommend upgrading your computer yourself unless
you are OK with trouble-shooting driver problems. This is not to say you
are going to have problems, as it is not very common to have a faulty
driver installed. If this isn\'t a risk that you want to take I offer a
[Windows 10 Install/Upgrade Service
Package](http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/services/home-office/windows-10-setup-package)
on my website.

:::
:::

Of course, if you run into trouble you can always uninstall Windows 10
from the recovery settings yourself. The install and uninstall process
takes about an hour depending on the speed of your computer and the
amount of applications and settings it needs to parsed to determine
compatibility.

Computing on the PC is going though some significant changes with the
rise of mobile technology. Microsoft is a big company with a wide set of
products that don\'t quite fit into the mobile market at this point.
Microsoft\'s release of Windows 10 is a step in that direction. Its an
attempt to unify the two with a similar experience on both devices. I
still do not see any future without a desktop market so I don\'t think
that desktops are going to be replaced for mobile devices, but I can see
desktop hardware becoming smaller and more portable.

### Upgrading

If you receive a notification you have until July 29th 2016, a year from
release to take advantage of the free upgrade offer. When you accept the
offer, after June 29th 2015 The Windows 10 Upgrade will be downloaded to
your PC one it has been released.

### The Pricing

For the people that don\'t or can\'t take advantage of the free upgrade
after July 29th 2016, the Home edition will run you 119.99 while the Pro
version is 199.99. You can also purchase the Pro Pack later for \$99.00
if you want to upgrade the Home edition later.
