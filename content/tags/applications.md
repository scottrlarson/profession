I install, setup, configure, and trouble-shoot web site applications for small businesses. If you want to setup a application for your website, or if you are having trouble with a current application I have the skills and expertise to track down issues and install applications. My history an expertise is in back-end reliability and security of application products. Sometimes the application needs to replaced with a better one, or the current application needs to be upgraded.
