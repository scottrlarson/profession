Did you know that solid state storage devices (SSD)'s have a life expectancy time line? A SSD is what your computer, or laptop stores and reads information on/from over the course of its life. The life span of the device has an endurance level. This means that a few factors will determine how well the storage device will endure over time. My experience is that, storage devices usually last between 3 and 5 years, but you can get away with more if you are an infrequent user of the device. If you have important data, or a configuration (The way your desktop and applications are setup) that would take your valuable time to re-setup, or rebuild, having a plan for what you are going to do when your device fails is really important.

### Symptoms that may decrease the life of your storage device

- The age of the device (when it was manufactured. Pre 2015 technology does not have same durability characteristics as newer technology.)
- How much, and how often information is written to the device: Depending on how your device is used, saving your important work data on some other storage device other than the system device may improve it's life. A micro flash drive is a good example of this. Saving your important work on another portable device may improve the durability of the internal system storage device. It also has the benefit of portability, you can move it between more than one device. (Please be sure to back this device up. If it becomes lost or damaged you data is lost forever. I suggest [Carbonite's Safe Plus plan](https://www.carbonite.com/backup-software/carbonite-safe), or for local backups [EaseUS ToDo Backup Plus](https://www.easeus.com/backup-software/tb-home.html)
- How much free space that is maintained on the device (Maintaining 1/2 of the space free increases the life expectancy of the device.)

### Using two devices (one for backup)

Some of my customers opt to have a second device on hand so they can continue working if there primary device goes down, but this requires file synchronization of some kind. Dropbox, or Allway Sync are to solutions that help with this dilemma.

### Disaster Recovery Backups

In the case of a single device if you cannot afford to be down for hours or days, a disaster recovery solution (Software that backs up your system configuration, along with your personal data, and applications) is important. A disaster recovery backup solution will allow you to restore your device's configuration back to the way it was before the failure, instead of rebuild your entire configuration (Reinstalling the Operating System, and programs. Or reconfiguring your personalization's).

My disaster recovery backup solution uses software, and a external storage device, like a USB hard drive, or a network attached storage device to regularly store a copy of your settings/configurations, programs, and personal data like documents, and music on a external storage device in the event of catastrophic failure. SSD's are more prone to catastrophic failures then Hard Disk Drives are. When the fail, the often fail in such a way that it requires very expensive techniques to recover that data. To prevent these kinds of failures, get setup with a backup and recovery plan of your device so you are not caught off guard.
