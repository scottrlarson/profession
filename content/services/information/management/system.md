### Definitions

- **S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) **is a monitoring system included in computer hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and eMMC drives. Its primary function is to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability with the intent of anticipating imminent hardware failures. When remotely monitoring S.M.A.R.T. It's possible to detect imminent storage drive failures, so preventative action can be taken to prevent data loss, the failing drive can be replaced and data integrity maintained. 

- **Backup redundancy** protects your data from data loss. In the instance of a local backup if you system is lost or taken a cloud backup would protect you against theft or loss.


- As of 2020 I use **Macrium Reflect as a Backup** and Disaster recovery solution. It is a reliable and well a tested product for making regular backups and restores of both system and personal data. Macrium Software was founded in 2006 when CEO and Founder Nick Sills experienced a personal data disaster and in the process discovered existing backup tools were not as good as he expected. Wanting a software solution that was practical and easy to use, Nick and his team developed Macrium Reflect to create a safe and secure disk image with ultra-fast recovery times should disaster strike.
