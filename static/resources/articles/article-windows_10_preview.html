<h3 id="the-showdown">The Showdown</h3>
<p>If you haven't already received the free upgrade notification on your computer about Windows 10, Microsoft says its due to be released around July or August. Its just been over two years since the release of Windows 8, a very short release cycle considering Microsoft's previous 3-4 year release cycle, primarily due to Microsoft's market share loss in the mobile device market. Reports show that Windows 8 is currently running on less that 15% of PC's, and less than 2.8% of mobile devices. Windows 8 was Microsoft's first entry into the mobile market with the introduction of the touch based tablet interface that was designed to combine both the mobile and desktop graphic interface into one integrated experience.</p>
<p>In my humble experience the Winows 8 tablet design didn't really work particularly well on PC and Laptop screens. PC's and Laptops now include a touch screen, but I dont think touch screens work that well in heavy work load environments. Desktops are primarily for productivity, you can get more done with a mouse and keyboard than you can on touch screen.</p>
<h3 id="the-war">The War</h3>
<p>The biggest frustration for me was not that it was necessarily a mobile experience designed for the desktop, but that I didn't quite know which world I was really living in: Was it a PC Desktop experience? Was it a mobile experience? Was it both? In Windows 8, Microsoft changed the Windows Start Menu into a touch display with panels for what I though would be all of my desktop shortcuts. That cold reasoning went out of the window when I first attempted to open the Internet Explorer browser. Instead of the IE Window I was used to seeing, I was instead forcibly brought into the world of full screen Metro applications designed for tablet displays that couldn't be resized. The original user desktop interface still existed, thankfully. For me since I don't use Windows Mobile devices I ended up hiding those features and sticking with desktop applications.</p>
<h3 id="the-questions">The Questions</h3>
<p>For this article I am testing the preview release of Windows 10. Windows 10 Preview is not a finished product by any means, so any features and limitations that I write about are subject to change when Windows 10 is released around the 29th. My testing has been ongoing for a couple of weeks since it's release. So, how does Windows 10 Preview stack up to Windows 8? Read on to see why I think Windows 10 an big improvement.</p>
<h3 id="the-answers">The Answers</h3>
<p>Some big improvements have been made to strengthen the usability of Windows 10 for desktop users. Navigating and using your desktop just became a lot simpler.</p>
<p><strong>The Start Menu</strong></p>
<div class="win10filmfeed">
<div class="win10filmstrip"><a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/StartMenu.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/StartMenu.png" alt="Windows 10 Start Menu Screenshot" class="win10articleimg"></a></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Replacing the touch screen in Windows 8, is the return of the Start Menu. It's really a combination of the Windows 7 Start Menu with a tablet panel that can be used to pin apps to. The best part about the new Start Menu is that doesn't interfere with your main shortcuts and recent applications list menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Changes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can pin your most recent applications to the tablet display just like you did in Windows 8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your most recent applications show up in a list just like they did in Windows 7.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="win10filmfeed">
<div class="win10filmstrip"><a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/StartMenu-AllProgramsList.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/StartMenu-AllProgramsList.png" alt="Windows 10 Start Menu All Programs Screenshot" class="win10articleimg"></a></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clicking on 'All Programs' opens up a navigation panel with a scrollable list of applications sorted alphabetically in large lettering making applications easier to find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power Options: Restart, Shutdown and Hibernate/Standby have returned as well, right above 'All Apps'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging off is now located under your Windows account name at the top of the Start Menu: You can change your account settings, lock the computer, or sign into a different account by left clicking on your account name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With a right click on your mouse the Start Button gives you a nice context menu with many settings to configure Windows. This change improves the accessibility to the back end features of Windows. This is a great feature for solution providers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Interface Improvements</strong></p>

</div>
<p>In Windows 10, Moving application windows around, and stacking them have become much more intuitive. It's easier to set two windows side by side. By dragging one of your application windows to the right or left, it snaps in place like Windows 7. Now in addition to the previous functionality, a preview of your other open Windows appears in the remaining space. If you click on one of those windows it snaps in place on the opposite side giving you a split screen view.</p>
<p>Microsoft introduced a nice feature for professionals that helps to organize work loads into separate virtual desktop areas. Its called the Task View.</p>
<p>With Task View, you can separate applications into specific virtual desktops and then switch between those VD's using the Task View Button. For example, you can have one VD with graphic editing applications, and on another VD with video editing applications.</p>
<p>With a few applications open you can see how this works. Check to see if the 'Taks View' Button <span class="win10icon"><img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Icon-TaskView.png" alt="Task View Icon Image"></span> is enabled by 'Right' clicking your mouse on an empty part of the Taskbar. <span class="win10screenshotback"> <a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Taskbar-Options-Task-View.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Taskbar-Options-Task-View.png" alt="Windows 10 Taskbar Options Context Menu Preview" class="win10screenshotimg"></a> </span> and putting a check mark on 'Show Task View button'</p>

</div>
<p>Now, by clicking on the 'Task View' button <span class="win10icon"><img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Icon-TaskView.png" alt="Task View Icon Image"></span>&nbsp; on the task bar near the 'Windows Search Field' a preview of all your open applications appear along with a desktop preview at the bottom. By clicking on the 'New Desktop' button <span class="win10icon"> <img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Icons-TaskView-NewDesktop.png" alt="New Desktop Icon Image"></span> you can add a new virtual desktop to this view.</p>

</div>
<p>At the bottom you should now see two desktop preview icons. You can then drag some windows from the preview into one of those desktops. Then, to switch between the two you can click on one of the desktop previews at the bottom. When you return to your Desktop, you can select an application on your task bar that you previously moved to a virtual desktop, and your desktop screen will scroll to the VD with those applications that you dropped into it. Its designed to prevent clutter and organize your different work loads more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Notification Sidebar</strong></p>
<div class="win10filmfeed">
<div class="win10filmstrip"><a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Notifications-SideBar.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Notifications-SideBar.png" alt="Windows 10 Notification Sidebar Preview" class="win10articleimg"></a></div>

</div>
<p>In Windows 7, notification bubbles that popped up on the system tray tended to get in the way, and clicking on one of the bubbles opened a separate notification window backgrounding your current application that was previously in focus. In Windows 10 notifications have been moved into a full fledged notification sidebar that is part of the main desktop interface. Any time you commit a change to a file, or a notification needs to update you about an operation a window scrolls in from the right side letting you know what happened. You can also bring up the notification sidebar without it interfering with your work to turn features on and off. You can change your touch screen/display settings, along with your PC's power and network options right from this Notification Sidebar.</p>
<p><strong>Search Tools</strong></p>
<div class="win10filmfeed">
<div class="win10filmstrip"><a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/SearchBar-SearchPop-Up-BingNews.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/SearchBar-SearchPop-Up-BingNews.png" alt="Windows 10 Searchbar Preview1" class="win10articleimg"></a></div>
</div>
<p>The Windows Search tool has changed significantly, it's become part of the Start Menu similar to the old Google Desktop Search that was discontinued. The built-in search tool is a bit more interactive than Google's Desktop Search. You can minimize the size of it by right clicking on the Task Bar (Not on any Pinned App) highlighting Search and choosing: 'Icon', or 'Disabled' if you don't plan on using it. <span class="win10screenshotback"> <a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Taskbar-Options-Search.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Taskbar-Options-Search.png" alt="Windows 10 Taskbar Search Options Context Menu Preview" class="win10screenshotimg"></a> </span></p>
<p>Searching for and Navigating search results and apps appear to be improved quite a bit. I dont particularily like web results mixed in with my local desktop search results and I couldnt find a way to remove this entirely as of yet. It will be interesting to see if and how this will be used.</p>
<p><strong>Cortana</strong></p>
<div class="win10filmfeed">
<div class="win10filmstrip"><a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/WindowsSearchDesktop-Cortana-Welcome.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/WindowsSearchDesktop-Cortana-Welcome.png" alt="Windows 10 Desktop Cortana Welcome Preview" class="win10articleimg"></a></div>
</div>
<p>Microsoft introduced Cortana, a new digital assistant tool that retrieves information you need now or might want in the future via text, or voice as you make requests for information. You can using it for planning trips, give you news updates about a particular subject, or have it remind you about a upcoming meeting. The voice recognition feature can help you dictate letters or emails and make them easy to send. It also has some features that listens to conversations so that it can help you plan out your life.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Edge</strong></p>
<p>Internet Explorer 11 is still part of Windows 10 so I don't know if they plan to replacing it in the future. Edge is Microsoft's new interactive web browser for searching the net making web pages more interactive. Edge has been redesigned with a new rendering engine improving interactive display performance on cutting edge hardware. The interactive tools allow you to take notes right onto web pages and share these interactive web pages with others. As you use Edge its suppose to learn what's important to you and makes that content easier to access. Right now Edge appears to be very unstable and I was unable to do an real testing with it. We will have to wait and see how well it works when Windows 10 is released.</p>
<h3 id="the-blue">The Blue</h3>
<p>There is a rumor that this will be the last release of a retail product and that Microsoft is moving in the direction of selling features as a service. You can see this move with the release of the office in the cloud service, Office365. It's not entirely clear if Microsoft is going to be heading in that direction with Windows 10. I do think Microsoft is in a better position to sell features that people need in the Windows Store that tie themselves into Windows.</p>
<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improved Interface: The Start Menu combines the best of both Windows 7 and Windows 8 making it easier to access apps and settings. Explorer Icons and Previews help you find the files you are looking for most.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved search features right from the Task Bar/Start Menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sleeker design making applications more space efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved reporting tools such as the new Notification Sidebar that helps you understand whats going on and improves the ability to change settings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Windows 10 is going to require better hardware, It does not run well on older hardware prior to 2012.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugs in the system make certain features unstable. Microsoft Edge itself was very buggy, but that should change with time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="win10filmfeed">
<div class="win10filmstrip"><a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Settings-Privacy-Microphone-VoiceSearch.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/images/windows10preview/Settings-Privacy-Microphone-VoiceSearch.png" alt="Windows 10 Desktop Privacy Settings Preview" class="win10articleimg"></a></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the Preview version's terms of service which has not yet been released to the public, Microsoft says it plans on collecting samples of certain information, it should be noted that all of these features have serious implications for abuse. At the moment the privacy settings for speech recognition and text is pretty flexible if you need to turn these features off, but that could be subject to change at any time. Microsoft terms of service details how this information will be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cortana's speech recognition will collect voice samples when you ask it questions and, it was mentioned that it would collect voice samples, and in some cases voice conversations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you input text, handwritten notices or ink comments, Microsoft may collect samples of your input to improve these features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you open a file, Microsoft may collect information about the file, the application used to open the file, and the performance impact of opening a file; to improve future implementations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>In Windows 10, the choices for when, and how Automatic Updates are installed has been someone simplified. When windows updates are ready to be downloaded and installed, you have two choices, Install or Postpone. If you chose install, updates are downloaded and installed immediately, along with drivers as well as system updates. Automatic driver updates is a cause for concern. For example, When I installed Windows 10 on my laptop, it updated my mouse driver to the latest version. The driver not being stable caused my system to crash every time I tried to use the mouse. To resolve the problem, I had to roll back the driver to the previous version. That change was only temporary though until another update happened, re-downloading and installing the same faulty driver that effected my laptop previously. Automatic driver updates is a nightmare waiting to happen. There are too many variables that can cause instability in the operation of functioning drivers. My guess is that automatic driver updates might change on release, or Windows Users will have to deal with any faulty driver updates as they happen. I will release a Windows 10 review update with any changes when Windows 10 is fully released on the 29th of July.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-reasons">The Reasons</h3>
<p>If you are purchasing a new computer I would say its worth giving it a try since the system comes prepackaged with the right drivers, but at this point I wouldn't recommend upgrading your computer yourself unless you are OK with trouble-shooting driver problems. This is not to say you are going to have problems, as it is not very common to have a faulty driver installed. If this isn't a risk that you want to take I offer a <a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/services/home-office/windows-10-setup-package">Windows 10 Install/Upgrade Service Package</a> on my website.</p>

</div>
<p>Of course, if you run into trouble you can always uninstall Windows 10 from the recovery settings yourself. The install and uninstall process takes about an hour depending on the speed of your computer and the amount of applications and settings it needs to parsed to determine compatibility.</p>
<p>Computing on the PC is going though some significant changes with the rise of mobile technology. Microsoft is a big company with a wide set of products that don't quite fit into the mobile market at this point. Microsoft's release of Windows 10 is a step in that direction. Its an attempt to unify the two with a similar experience on both devices. I still do not see any future without a desktop market so I don't think that desktops are going to be replaced for mobile devices, but I can see desktop hardware becoming smaller and more portable.</p>
<h3 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h3>
<p>If you receive a notification you have until July 29th 2016, a year from release to take advantage of the free upgrade offer. When you accept the offer, after June 29th 2015 The Windows 10 Upgrade will be downloaded to your PC one it has been released.</p>
<h3 id="the-pricing">The Pricing</h3>
<p>For the people that don't or can't take advantage of the free upgrade after July 29th 2016, the Home edition will run you 119.99 while the Pro version is 199.99. You can also purchase the Pro Pack later for $99.00 if you want to upgrade the Home edition later.</p>
