<h3>In-Shop</h3>
<p>Any equipment left behind for over a period of 120 days from the date of service will be destroyed/recycled. Depending on my time constraints, I will make a effort to contact you, this usually involves all of the following during this 120 day period: a few calls, an email and a post letter. If I am not able to reach you, or you do not respond to any of my communications within this time frame, regardless of the reason, I am assuming you do not want whatever equipment you have left behind, and your equipment will be irrevocably destroyed/sold to cover any costs.
