      <description>#3 - IFixit  iFixit is a wiki-based site that teaches people how to fix almost anything. Anyone can create a repair manual for a device, and anyone can also edit the existing set of manuals to improve them. The site empowers individuals to share their technical knowledge with the rest of the world.
I use the ifixit site for disassembly reference for laptops. But I also purchase parts from the site I cannot find anywhere else.</description>
