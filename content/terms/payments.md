## In-shop Servicing
All payments can be made via check or cash. If you prefer to pay by credit card, you can paypal me money at slarson -at- scottrlarson.com or by venmo at @scottrlarson. Payments are due upon pick-up of your device.

## At-location & Online Servicing
I require payment before I leave the location where I provide you service unless special arrangements are made for recurring service. In this cause I will bill you for that service, upon receipt of a bill of service, you have two weeks to pay that bill.

### Notice about late payments
There is a $1.00 fee (Per Day) for late payments. Too many late or unpaid bills will result in services being halted at a time of my discretion. Repeated late or unpaid bills will result in the termination of the service relationship.
