I come alive, when I get out my own way. After I had a Cerebral Hemmorage back in 2017, my phsiology changed. I will call this health challenge "The Event" moving forward. A turning point in my life that was on the level of how an earthquake shakes up the landscape. I spontanously developed differnt habbits and goals for my life. And it changed the kind of person I was destine to be.  New habits sprung up automatically and without any prompting:  A daily morning morning regiment, increased productivity in my pursuits, and a unending peace, or lack of fear for the future that I cannot explain. I enjoy habits which bring on new pursuits, but I still carry this overwhelming feeling of loss with me everywhere I go. I believe "The Event" created a soul purpose within me to become a new man. One that is patient, kind and understanding.

I have noticed throughout my life that certain mental states have this quality of frustration, pushing me to my limits. Or at least I allow this metal force to push me into places in my inner world that I'd rather not go. My first thought was to get out into the woods. How I missed walking in the woods, and listening to that deep sound of silence.  So one weekend instead of doing my normal routine, I packed up my great and headed out to Armstrong Woods in Gurneville, CA.

My journey started on the East Ridge path.

How utterly quiet this forest is. The only sound is the wind, and an occasional squawk from a bird. I look back at the parking lot, wondering when I am going to return. Will I get lost this time? I think not. I get to the first turn, stopping in the middle of the path, hoping to see some sign of a Raven (A sign I take for interpersonal change). As I look for photo opportunities, two men in their sixties walk past me. One says to me, "A man after my own heart, one who takes his time." I laugh as they pass, thinking about the irony in that statement. Most of my life I was rushing from one thing to the next, with little regard for time. As I advance in years, Im learning that the important things in life can only be experienced by taking time.

After the two men pass, I look around again. I see two Redwoods growing out of the same place in the earth. They reach into the sky, drawing strength from each other. Redwoods often grow as close together as possible to protect each other from the elements. I almost lose my balance on the steep incline, trying to pano-capture the pair with my SmartPhone.

I turn back to the path to leave, and see a feather on the ground, next to a neighboring Redwood. I'm not sure if it was a Eagle feather, one of the strongest birds in existence. Eagle feathers are a symbol for me of what's most important in life. I decide that this is a symbol that the universe is much more stronger and bigger than any problem I might have. A humbling feeling sets in.

Further along the path, I came upon a bench that had fallen over.

![The broken on the mend](/img/travelogues/armstrong-woods-reflections/bench.jpg)

This bench will be mended one day, to be a place of peace and rest for weary travelers. It reminds me of my once broken life. Now I stand erect, and unbroken until the ending of the world, carrying myself though these trial-by-fire days. The world is in such a state of change its almost unbearable to me. There is so much conflict, but also so much peace in the world to be discovered. The one that gets realized is the one that is fed the most, I gather.

I see a little house house in the distance, across the stream.  It's probably a storage shed for the park but my in my mind's eye I see a small cabin built on a hill in the forest. A man of the woods arrives. Opens the door, and in the window I see him lay down to rest after a long day. Life in the forest doesn't require much. Just food, shelter, and a warm hearth. The cabin is right on the edge of a chasm. At the bottom the sound of a stream can be heard. This day dream reminds me of a movie, about a veteran that lived in a forest preserve with his daughter. They were caught by some authority figures. I'm pretty sure that the daughter wanted to be caught, she looked tired of living in the wild. They eventually found themselves in a camp where she was able to stay with others. Her father appeared to be uneasy in their new company and wanted to leave, but she stayed. He went back into the wild deal with his demons, and the daughter stayed behind. The community left food out for their lost loved ones. Life is best when we are free to deal with our personal demons, on our own terms, without the forced interference of a sick society. A society that uses violence to wall off what we do not understand so we don't have to remember how lost we have become.

I found a stone sitting area, it reminded me of an relic from a bygone age. This one is missing a fountain in its center. In my imagination, celebrations would happen here.  There might have been a marriage here, or a stage play. People would be laughing, and enjoying each others company. This structure would be in the center of a village, where the villagers would meet. Discover the day to day happenings.

I imagine this Redwood to have a cave at the base of the trunk. I go in, and never come out. But once I'm down there, I go through my own personal trial-by-fire. Whatever is holding me back in my life, up on the surface, I find the solution to it here. Underneath the earth, where it's dark, I come to an understanding with myself. I will take heart, and not take life for granted, as I once did when I was young.

This looks like a outcropping of rock formations, but its actually the roots of an enormous Redwood tree. Its call Armstrong Tree by the park. One day it had enough, and fell over. But it's still here, after all this time. Just like us. We can fall over, but we get back up, and we can be remembered for what we do after we fall.

Long ago I did a small study of my last name. The origin of the name "Larson" comes from the historic Scandinavian country of Sweden. The surname "Larson" is derived from the the Nordic word Lars, which is a pet form of the name Lawrence. This name is in turn derived from the Latin name Laurentius, which literally means man from Laurentium, a town in Italy named for its laurel trees. The bay leaf from a laurel tree has healing properties and Native Amercians used it to heal many malides. I find the connection between the name and the tree very interesting as the smell of the leaf always brings me peace.

A real life starts with being patient like these tress, kind like the wind, and understanding like the elderly men I met on the path. I grieve for something lost on the path of life, but the discovery of what is true and vital to my wellbeing brings me closer to that piece of myself that was lost long ago.

## Author's Note
This piece would not have been possible without the help of the [Mankind Project](http://mkp.org) in my life. After "The Event" I was led to the [New Warrior Training Adventure](https://mankindproject.org/new-warrior-training-adventure/) where I discovered my calling.  The Mankind Project is a organization that helps men become ethical creators of life in this modern age of decadence.

You can read about [my initiation](http://www.scottrlarson.com/testimonials/testimonial-mkp/) into manhood with the help of the Mankind Project.

You can read more about about what happened to me before all of this in my book "[Most Improved](http://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-most-improved/)". 

If you have any questions you can [contact](/#contact) me.
