&lt;p&gt;This is the 1st part of a 3 part series in protecting yourself from on-line and of-line scams.&lt;/p&gt;

If your &lt;strong&gt;device has been compromised&lt;/strong&gt; by a scam, its important to &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance3#protecting-yourself-after-the-scam&#34;&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt; how to deal with an attack after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance3#terms&#34;&gt;Terms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-best-security-is-awareness&#34;&gt;The best security is awareness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many security measures can help protect your device, but when you become the target, awareness, and education is your best defense. In the last five or ten years, as computer security keeps getting better, many attackers have moved from computer infiltration to targeting &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; through what&amp;rsquo;s called a &amp;ldquo;Social Engineering Attack&amp;rdquo;. A term used to encompass a broad range of malicious activities to extort money from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social engineering attacks happen in one or more steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An attacker does background research on a set of victims in a specific demographic. The goal is to target the most vulnerable people of society, like the elderly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vulnerabilities are discovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Armed with the necessary information from step one and two, the attacker uses psychological manipulation in the form of a pointed written message, or phone conversation, to trick you into giving away sensitive information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attackers will likely attempt to trick you with a message that conveys an &lt;strong&gt;illusion of authority&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:illusion-authority&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:illusion-authority&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and a sense of urgency. As an example, you may get a pop-up on your screen that your computer has been compromised, asking you to urgently call a number. You might get an email stating that you are required by law to make contact with a government representative because the IRS didn&amp;rsquo;t receive your tax return, or you might even get a call from the attacker, without any action on your part, claiming to be working for Microsoft and that your computer is unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With any unfamiliar situation, remember to take a deep breath and relax. 99% of communications that attempt to compel you to act with the above tactics are false. These kinds of attacks are most successful when you are in a state of panic. Legitimate business dealings happen on their own with no outside coercion. If at any time you feel forced to perform an action, step back, regroup, and gather information from outside sources. In these circumstances, you never, ever, have to take an immediate action. You always have recourse, but it takes time and patience to find alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most likely indicators of a social engineering attack include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urgency&lt;/strong&gt;: A communication that expresses a tremendous sense of urgency, often through fear, intimidation, a crisis, or an important deadline. Attackers can be good at creating convincing messages that appear to come from an authority, or even someone you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;:  A message that creates a sense of &amp;ldquo;No Option&amp;rdquo;. The language indicates that you must act right away, and many interactions will even attempt to get you to bypass or ignore security measures designed to protect you, such as giving out your password to your online bank account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illusion of Authority&lt;/strong&gt;: A author or caller who uses an authoritative tone of voice or a written strong-worded message. This kind of interaction can be framed in many ways, but it works best when an attacker impersonates an agent from a government establishment or a reputable company. The attacker will attempt to use language that sounds authoritative to gain a position of superiority over you. The ultimate goal is to get you to perform an action that, on the surface, appears to benefit you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-psychology-behind-decision-making&#34;&gt;The psychology behind decision making&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to learn a bit about your decision-making process. Recognize your particular temperament when it comes to obstacles and challenges. Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you hold up under pressure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you need to avoid circumstances that lead you to make snap decisions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you practice breathing, and walking away?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemplate on these questions and make a reminder or a mental note for any future dealings with aggressive queries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal in the first part of this publication is to attempt to make you aware of some of the common ways in which a scammer operates. When dealing with solicited requests for information, don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to err on the side of caution. It&amp;rsquo;s better to be safe, then sorry. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance2&#34;&gt;part 2&lt;/a&gt; I will discuss techquies of avoiding being a victim of a Scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:illusion-authority&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illusion of authority&lt;/strong&gt; is a term to describe a psychological interaction between two individuals or a group. An author of a letter, email, call or in-person encounter attempts to put themselves in a position of authority by using psychological tactics against you in an attempt to get you acquiesce your freedom of choice.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:illusion-authority&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;avoiding-scams&#34;&gt;Avoiding Scams&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-results&#34;&gt;Search Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skipping Ads with an Adblocker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid Ad listings in search results entirely, you can use a reputable Adblocker. Be aware that not all adblockers are created equal, some disguise themselves as adblockers, but instead deliver Ad&amp;rsquo;s to your computer. I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://adblockplus.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Adblock Plus&lt;/a&gt; add-on/extension in Firefox and Google Chrome. It strips out Ad related content from many search engine results. This is the most effective way to protect you from malicious search results. Do not worry about losing any important results. Ad results are only companions to organic search results. If a result shows up in an Ad. I will show up in the search result if it is relevant to the search term. You might run into an occasion where you might need to whitelist a particular site from being blocked, and you can do that through the settings of the adblocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding Ads with Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not want to use an Adblocker you can avoid malicious Ad results by knowing what to look for. The image below shows how Google, Yahoo, and Bing layout their Ad based search results. Headings highlighted in red contain the Ad listings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/search-results-ads.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ad Laden Search Result Example 1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search sites like those listed above have a platform for submitting Ads. This allows any &amp;ldquo;Joe&amp;rdquo; to create Ad campaigns that link directly to every day relevant search terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;content-block-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/google-advertising-policies.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/google-advertising-policies.png&#34; alt=&#34;Google&#39;s Advertising Policies Screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google has a reporting system for malicious Ads, but by the time Google gets around to correcting the problem, you can be tricked into visiting a malicious site, and if you interact with that site, by then it&amp;rsquo;s usually too late. In some cases, your device can be compromised without any interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;clearfix&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/Browly-scam.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/Browly-scam.png&#34; alt=&#34;Browly Scam Example 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search results that are labeled &amp;ldquo;Ad&amp;rdquo; (See screen-shot above) can be redirected to an alternate site. This means that if you click on a link that you know is reputable, Google inserts itself in the middle and hijacks that link to send you to another location on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately you want to avoid any of the search results that fall under the label &amp;ldquo;Advertisement&amp;rdquo;. Watch out for changes, many search engines change the way Ads are delivered on the search results page. Ad labeled search results usually appear at the top, a list of results can appear under one heading labeled &amp;ldquo;Advertisements&amp;rdquo;, or the label is tagged to each result itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organic search results are ones that are not commercially supported and as such are less likely to have shenanigans attached to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;pop-up-warnings-or-error-messages&#34;&gt;Pop-up Warnings or Error Messages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/eugjt.club-scam.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pop-Up Scam&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the scope of normal computer use, legitimate warnings or error messages never include phone numbers. Some specific business applications, like Quickbooks, are the exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you receive an error message, or warning on your screen that you cannot get out of, do not interact with it in any way. Instead, you could immediately &lt;strong&gt;shutdown the computer&lt;/strong&gt; by way of the &lt;strong&gt;power button&lt;/strong&gt;. You can power down the computer by &lt;strong&gt;holding the power button down for 5-10 seconds and waiting until the screen goes black&lt;/strong&gt;. Please note that there is a slight chance of data loss when you shutdown your computer in this fashion, but if you cannot get your computer to respond to a shutdown or restart command, or use the Task Manager to kill the task in question, it is my understanding these are the only options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;call-based-scams&#34;&gt;Call-based Scams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/health-center-call-center_759.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Call center scam&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trick to &lt;strong&gt;handling inbound call scams&lt;/strong&gt; is to realize that, under most circumstances, obtaining computer support requires that you initiate the contact by your own means. When you receive an unsolicited call from an unknown agent, claiming to be from any legitimate establishment with the intent to offer you any kind of support, hang up. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple. Remember to maintain awareness of your decision-making psychology and don&amp;rsquo;t put yourself into situations that cause you to make snap decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not make outbound calls&lt;/strong&gt; from any error or warning message that appears on any of your devices. Remember the 3 indicators of a social engineering attack: &lt;strong&gt;Urgency&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Illusion of Authority&lt;/strong&gt;. If you need assistance, break away from the task at hand and ask a trusted person instead of blindly following a path that is laid out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;email-based-scams&#34;&gt;Email-based Scams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/publications/scam-avoidance/scam-email-thunderbird.png&#34; alt=&#34;Microsoft Office365 Email Scam&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making decisions on how to respond to emails that ask you to perform an action can be tricky. There are two categories of inbound emails from any provider:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legitimate requests to review information about your accounts or services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illegitimate scams that attempt to portray themselves as legitimate requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you receive an email asking you to perform an action, keep in mind the three basic qualifiers of legitimacy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who&lt;/strong&gt; is the email sender? Are you receiving an email from Microsoft asking you about your email? Do you even have an email with Microsoft? Find out who your mail provider is. If it&amp;rsquo;s not Microsoft, delete the message. If you do have an Email with Microsoft move on to the next step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; is the message asking me to do? Depending on the request, you can sometimes tell that the message is suspect by the way the message is crafted, or by the nature of the request. If the email states that an account you own is on hold because of a billing problem and the message requests that you click on a link to remedy the problem, instead, open up your web browser and visit the site by using &lt;strong&gt;web browser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:web-browser&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:web-browser&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to confirm that problem exists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where&lt;/strong&gt; will I land if I act? Without clicking on any links in the email, move your mouse over the link and look at the destination URL. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain a recognizable location, you know you got a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-respond-to-calls-for-help-from-family-friends-or-colleagues&#34;&gt;How to respond to calls for help from family, friends, or colleagues.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, you may encounter a situation, usually by email or social networking, where a contact looks to be someone close to you, who reaches out to you for help in some way. Many scammers steal the identity of a person to target the victims network of contacts. Once the identity has been compromised is some way, the attacker will trying to appeal to individuals in the victims network with a request of good will by crafting a message of help. The message will probably look like a request for money. The contact might mention a travel situation where the contact is in a bind and needs help. Then there might be a link to send that person money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another regular method of attack is to trick an individual from victims network into giving away personal details, like bank account information, or any site where your credit card is stored by convincing the target to click on a link that takes the victim to a page that looks like a legitimate website, but instead is a malicious site used to steal account credentials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to deal with these situations is to try to reach out using outside methods. Call the contact and verify via voice that the message is legit. If you cant reach the person, call or text a close friend and see if they know anything about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal in this part of the series was to show you some ways in which a scammer might trick you into giving away personally identifying information with some ways you can avoid this. In &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-scam-avoidance3&#34;&gt;part 3&lt;/a&gt; I will discuss ways to protect yourself after you have become a victim of a scam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;protecting-yourself-after-the-scam&#34;&gt;Protecting yourself after the Scam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have already been a victim of an scam. The first thing to do is to stop the interaction with the attacker. If you have given the attacker access to your technology, shutdown the device and contact me for free evaluation. In most cases its safer to &lt;strong&gt;factory restore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:factory-restore&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:factory-restore&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; the device than to try and target the intrusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;protect-your-on-line-accounts&#34;&gt;Protect your on-line accounts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change your passwords for important online accounts like your social networking, email and finical services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use a strong passwords, and do not use the same password for all of your important online accounts. Better yet, get to know and use a password manager. A &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/recommendations/recommendation-password-managers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;password manager&lt;/a&gt; will help you create complicated passwords without having to remember them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find that one or more of your accounts are repeatedly getting hacked, and your not sure where the breach is, one area that often gets overlooked is smart phone security. To find out more about security your smartphone, read my &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-smartphone-protection&#34;&gt;Protecting Your Smartphone From Being Hacked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; which delves into advanced &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-smartphone-protection#2-factor-authentication&#34;&gt;2 factor authentication methods&lt;/a&gt;. Many online services still use the insecure smartphone text based method, which is really a liability instead of a strength. If your thinking about purchasing an identity theft protection service, read my publication &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-id-theft-what-why/&#34;&gt;What is Identity Theft Protection, and do you need it?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contact your financial institutions and let them know you have been a victim of a scam. Get your credit cards reissued&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal in this publication was to attempt to make you aware of some of the common ways in which a scammer operates, but there may be other methods that are outside of its scope. When dealing with solicited requests for information, don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to err on the side of caution. It&amp;rsquo;s better to be safe, then sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;2020/04/24**: There is a very interesting video called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le71yVPh4uk&amp;amp;feature=emb_title&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spying on the Scammers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;  that was release on Youtube in March of 2020 detailing how these scamming operations run and outlines some of the tactics they use. For anyone that wants to avoid the headache and financial loss of becoming a victim of a phone scam (or any scam for that matter), I strongly advise watching this 4 part series. Knowing how these operations run creates awareness that you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally have.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>What is Identity Theft Protection, and do you need it?</title>
      <link>http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-id-theft-what-why/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It is relatively easy from the standpoint of a thief to impersonate your online identity and assume your financial standing. Using your identity, a thief can open up a line of credit under your name and go on a shopping spree making you assume all of the responsibility until you rectify the problem. As more and more of our personal information gets warehoused online, protecting information against theft is a continuing challenge on both sides of the fence, customers and financial institutions alike. Just recently, an IRS employee stole $70,000 from the government using identities of a few taxpayers and went on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://qz.com/1723855/an-irs-employee-stole-identities-went-on-spending-spree/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2-year long spending spree&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottrlarson.com/updates/update-smartphone-protection/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;online security measures&lt;/a&gt; now exist that make it very difficult to assume a person&amp;rsquo;s digital identity, but each institution that hosts online services to their customers needs to implement it. I touch on this at the end of this article. On the one hand, they want to, and do respond to threats after the fact pretty well. On the other hand, real security is about  preventing attacks in the first place.  Most well established financial institutions are large behemoths and do not like change. In most cases many will most likely play the “wait and see” game to assess which of these security measures becomes a standard. While outdated security implementations exist (Which become weak points of attack over time), thieves are taking advantage of the situation while they can. This is where Identity Theft Protection (ITP) Services come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/img/updates/identity-protection-services/identity-theft-protection-services.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Identity Theft Protection Services Photo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface, ITP services like Lifelock seem to act as an intermediary that aims to preemptively protect against theft of personal information, and respond to suspicious activity at the source, usually a bank or financial institution. Personal information like your name, address, mobile number, social security number, and birth date can be stored with these third parties. The information is used by financial institutions to provide you with corresponding services. This is why these institutions are often under attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At $120 a year, ITP Services use these online systems (already accessible to the public) and further automate them to provide you with regular updates under one account controlled by the ITP service. The idea is that the ITP service acts on your behalf, interacting with your bank, or financial institution, to correct personal information inaccuracies, or act on an instance of fraud activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that in the world of information security, there are business minded people that use fear to profit on the uninformed, and there are security minded people who try to educate. I definitely fall into the latter camp. I would rather people become better informed on how to protect their information, than to support a system that puts many of its customers in the passenger seat of information security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, information security can be complex, especially if you have multiple accounts with multiple financial institutions. Due to your financial solvency, if you are finding that your information is constantly being compromised, or that you might be a good target for an attacker, it might be worth it for you to pay an ITP service to help you protect your identity. The drawback is that you have to trust another third party (and its employees) with all of your personal identifying information. This could be another angle of attack for some, but if you have already become accustomed to giving out your personal information to any service that asks for it, without question, or you are required to, then it might benefit you to have one more link in the chain work for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-strong-points-of-itp-services&#34;&gt;The Strong Points of ITP Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ITP services attempt to be proactive by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flagging all three credit bureaus with a fraud alert on a regular basis. This forces financial institutions to contact you personally before a line of credit gets opened in your name. This makes it harder for criminals to impersonate you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As a secondary benefit to the fraud alerts, these services may also collate important about changes to your personal information from various sources in an account that you can view at-a-glance. Focusing on your current credit report, changes to your stored contact information, and any data-mining campaigns that you have been opted into. Thus, making it easier to opt-out of any programs you have been opted into with or without your knowledge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-weak-points-of-itp-services&#34;&gt;The Weak Points of ITP Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the most part, ITP services seem slow to respond to real-time fraud activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to ITP services’ dependence on outside automated systems, the information the service gathers can often contain inaccurate data. This requires a manual review by you, or the ITP service&amp;rsquo;s own staff, increasing the length of time it takes to act on a discrepancy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My research has shown, based on the experience of customers that have tried and reviewed these services, that ITP services do not offer much beyond what financial services already offer except to babysit your accounts for you, however slowly. You can protect yourself by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2FA (two-factor authentication)&lt;/a&gt; paired with an authenticator app using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_algorithm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TOTP (Time-based One-time Password)&lt;/a&gt; and/or a USB/NFC device that uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;U2F (Universal 2nd Factor)&lt;/a&gt; for sites that support it wherever possible. Replace text based two-factor authentication with the above as soon as you can, and when you do disable text based two-factor on your account. If your smartphone gets compromised, the text-messaging based two-factor authentication can be easily circumvented, or redirected to an attackers mobile by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;social engineering&lt;/a&gt; your mobile provider to get them to swap your mobile account to another sim card. You can read more about how to secure your mobile phone and online accounts in my article &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scottrlarson.com/updates/update-smartphone-protection/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Protecting Your Smartphone From Being Hacked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a web browser with some kind of scripting protection. I use Firefox with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Noscript Addon&lt;/a&gt;, but there is a Chrome &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noscript/doojmbjmlfjjnbmnoijecmcbfeoakpjm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;noscript extension&lt;/a&gt; as well now. This prevents sites from using aggressive forms of tracking techniques to steal information (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Clickjacking&lt;/a&gt;). These add-ons/extensions help prevent your computer from leaking information about you, but they might also change your browsing experience in such a way that might prevent you from accessing certain areas of specific websites. Depending the amount of scripting a site uses, many of these types of sites do not react well when the scripting becomes disabled.  In these cases having scripting protection depends on your ability to white-list sites that you know are safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stopdatamining.me/opt-out-list/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Opting out of data mining practices with the major data brokers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have been victim of identity theft already, you can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0497-credit-freeze-faqs#place&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Freeze your credit report&lt;/a&gt; If you have been a victim of ID theft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.identitytheft.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;File a ID theft report with the Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being aware of exactly what, or how much information about you is online, and closing out, or making an effort to remove information you do not want online. If you want to see how much of your personal info is available online, you can pay a site such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://radaris.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Radaris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.advancedbackgroundchecks.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Advanced Background Checks&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.publicrecordsnow.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Public Records Now&lt;/a&gt; to search out what is available about you. Please note these sites are not exactly legal and they may disappear and reappear under different names, at will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing a mindset of data protection at all times. Always resist attempts to put your information in a computer system. Don&amp;rsquo;t let your dentist have your SSN without a fight. Don&amp;rsquo;t let them have your real birthday without asking why they need it and &lt;strong&gt;asking if it&amp;rsquo;s required&lt;/strong&gt;, or more importantly: &amp;ldquo;By what authority are you obligating me to provide YOU with this information?&amp;rdquo; Obviously this is going to slow down your intake process and you might get denied service by some providers. If a service requires too much personally identifiable information from you that can be used in a way to steal your identity, is it really worth it to use that service?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activating a fraud alert by contacting (by phone, or online, one of the major credit bureaus: (No need to contact all three, as they are required to communicate fraud alerts with each other. Remember to renew the fraud alert every 90 days.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alerts.equifax.com/AutoFraud_Online/jsp/fraudAlert.jsp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Equifax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.experian.com/fraud/center.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Experian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transunion.com/fraud-alerts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TransUnion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three major credit bureaus are required to provide you with a free credit report once a year, apply for a report using the respective bureaus websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-delete-your-data-securely-macos&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;How to Delete Your Data Securely on macOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a good guide that explains how to securely delete data from a Mac, but it also references a PC. These instructions might be beyond the capabilities for the average computer user, but it&amp;rsquo;s still good to know what is involved in securely deleting data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you get rid of an old computer that has data on it, that has not been securely deleted, that data can be mined by people that have an interest in stealing your assets, or impersonating you to hide criminal behavior. Its very difficult, and/or time consuming dealing with identify theft if you do not know how your information is being used without your consent. Think be for you throw away a device that might have information about you that you do not want to fall into the wrong hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best bet is to hirer me, I can &lt;a href=&#34;http://scottrlarson.com/services/information/security/data/&#34;&gt;securely delete sensitive data&lt;/a&gt; before you recycle or give away your legacy device.&lt;/p&gt;
