      <description>Check my hours for availability.
Payment Terms Ongoing service rates are determined by the immediacy, or the day/time a service is requested. Services that require a faster turn-around time are priced higher than services that can wait. I also offer flat rates, price ranges and quotes for project based services. For in-shop services, if you require a more specific out-the-door cost and want to know more about what kinds of services I offer, check the main menu of my website.</description>
