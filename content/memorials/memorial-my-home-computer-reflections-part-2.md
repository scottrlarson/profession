This article is a companion piece on the evolution of the Home Computer and the cultural impact technology has on society today. It's a glimpse at where computing culture was, and were its heading. 

This article is part of a 5 part series:

My first experience with computers started in the early 1980's on one of the first home computers, the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A. I was about 12 years old. Relatively expensive, but affordable to many middle class families, Home Computers ranged around a thousand dollars in value.

During the introduction of the first models, my family and I did not have a home computer, but fortunately we had a friend who's mother must have saw the value in kids playing with computers and had the resources to purchase one for her son. The reasons why I will never know as I lost contact with them. "**Tunnels of Doom**" became the hot title at the time. As far as I know, it was the first multi-player turn-based [dungeon crawler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_crawl) released at that time. We started our morning loading our previous save game data from cassette tape. After several hours and a home cooked dinner, our game would be loaded. We each took our respective turns exploring a procedurally generated dungeon, engaging in battles with monsters, and restoring fallen comrades. I remember it being the first continuous game experience where I learned to cooperate with other players to complete objectives that spanned more than one sitting.

A few years after my experience with the TI994a, my parents noticed my enthusiasm around computing. I think they saw the home computer as a step up from my childhood dream of getting myself into trouble at school.

A quick side note, I had brief introduction into electronics theory and practicalities by my Uncle Jim, who worked as a electrician in WWII, and later became a city electrician. When my parents went away on vacation, they would ship me to Chicago to visit my Uncle. He showed me the basics of ac/dc current. A few years of my life was spent in his basement, building small electronic devices together. Maybe that's why I jump at the prospect of getting my hands on newly released gadgets today.  

As far as electronics go, the computer was, and is, a different beast. Obviously, the inner workings of a computer operates on the same principles of electric current. But what makes home computers different from electronics is the software programming aspect of it. Programming is like creating a list of instructions for something to happen. At the end of the day, is really all about flipping switches. Flipping a sequence of switches actually, in a way the computer can understand.

This enthusiasm got me my first computer, a Commodore 64. I'm skipping the part where my real first computer was a TRS-80.  Back then, it was considered the [Trash 80](https://dfarq.homeip.net/trash-80-what-it-meant-and-why-it-stuck/) by my compadres. It was as good of a computer as any during that time, except for it's initial limitations that could be expanded with add-on hardware making the cost significantly lager then the original price of the product. It's very similar to how computer games ship nowadays, half-completed, then being sold the completed parts of the game in expansions. This half-computer developed bad reputation of not being a complete experience. You couldn't do much with it without upgrading the hardware.

Anyways, forget I ever said anything about the TRS-80, act as if it never happened, while we move on to big and better things in the next part of this series.
