<p>Please back up your data or talk to me about a backup strategy before having any work done. Data loss can happen, and you agree not to hold me liable, nor responsible for any form of data loss.</p>

<p>In the process of updating software, or making changes to the way software functions on your device, bugs and errors can be introduced by the way in which software interacts with the operating system. Also failures in the functioning of hardware could be introduced as a result of my servicing. Some of the resulting failures could be related to, but not limited to: design flaws, wear and tear, glitches, bugs, you or any third part mishandling of hardware/software prior to servicing or improper maintenance. If this situations arises, additional costs outside the quoted or estimated fees might be required. My liability and responsibility stops at my [service guarantee](service-guarantee). If I fail to complete a specific piece of work, or I misconfigure/mishandle your device I will take responsibility. </p>

<p>Any equipment left behind for over a period of 120 days from the date of service will be destroyed/recycled. Depending on my time constraints, I will make an effort to contact you, even though I am not required to. This may involve all of the following during this 120 day period: a few calls, an email, a text message, and a post letter. If I am not able to reach you, or you do not respond to any of my communications within this time frame, regardless of the reason, I am assuming you do not want whatever equipment you have left behind, and your equipment will be irrevocably destroyed/sold to cover any costs. I will do my best to secure wipe your data to protect your privacy, but I am not liable for any results that occur from any kind of breach to your personal data from devices that are in my care even though I excel at protecting your data while your device is in my care.
