<p>If I require communication from you on resolving an issue where I cannot complete a  requested task without that communication it is not my responsibility to provide you with reoccurring communications or reminders. I will send one communication via whatever means you require and it will be your responsibility to respond. If your failure to follow up or a late response on a communication prevents or delays me from performing on a task you require from me, that failure to communicate does not cancel my billable rate involved in performing on that task or subsequent follow up tasks that result due to delayed or failed communications.</p>
