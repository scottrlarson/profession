<p>I will respond to communications within 3hrs or less unless its nearing the end of the day, I am on a emergency appointment where I cannot get away, I am on vacation, or it is on the weekend. If any of these situations occur I will respond to any and all communications on the next business day, when I return from vacation, or after the holiday. </p>
