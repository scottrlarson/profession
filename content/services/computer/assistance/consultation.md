I offer one on one in-office consultations to advise, or offer solutions to any consumer, or small office related technical challenge. To see my at-location consultation/evaluation rates, see my [Availability Hours & Rates](/#rates).  I sit down with you, record information about your problem, offer a analysis/resolution, or a cost estimate. This information can be handed to you in print format or emailed to you electronically.

<ul>
<li>A free 20-minute initial consultation.</li>
<li>An estimate of work involved, required parts and costs.</li>
<li>Or a quick recommendation on a replacement device.</li>
</ul>
