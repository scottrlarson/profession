All payments can be made via check or cash. If you prefer to pay by credit card, you can [paypal](paypal.me/scottrlarson) me, or [venmo me](https://account.venmo.com/u/scottrlarson) at @scottRlarson. On Venmo, my handle is connected to the business part of their service. So if you do not see my listing, switch to the business tab.

## In-shop Servicing
Payments are due upon pick-up of your device.



## At-location
I require payment before I leave the location where I provide you service unless special arrangements are made for recurring service in advance (regardless of the outcome). In this case I will bill you for that service, upon receipt of a bill of service, you have two weeks to pay. 

## Online Servicing
I will bill you for this service after it's completed, upon receipt of a bill of service, you have two weeks to pay that bill.

## Notice about late payments
There is a $1.00 fee (Per Day) for late payments. Too many late or unpaid bills will result in services being halted at a time of my discretion, or your service will be reprioritized for timely paid customers. **Repeated late or unpaid bills will result in the termination of the service relationship.**
