From a technology and culture perspective This piece is a look at where we have been, and where we are heading as a society. This article is a companion piece to "Reflections on the Home Computer Golden Age". 
[TOC]

This is my personal take on the evolution of the Home Computer. A Home Computer is one of the first computers that were designed for the home which eventually created the [technology revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_revolution) we see today. 

I tinkered with computer hardware and software as a kid. As a young adult and leared how to service computers from people in the repair business. Now I run my own computer repair service and for over 20 years I have been providing technical assistance to home users and very small businesses. 

This piece is for people interested in the evolution and the social impact of computer technology. Even though I have some acdemic schooling in my past, my interests lie in the non-academic parts of life and my primary mode of learning is self-education. 

The home computer scene of my time was a creative revoliution centered around the hacking scene. It was a time of endless potential and I saw many creative technologies push the limits of what was possible. This might be true today, but for me, innovation of this time is losing much of its appeal. Endevors have this "Making Money" quality to it that removes all the spirit of what was like to generate for the common good. 

The golden age of the Home Computer revolution ended abruptly in the early nineties when technolgy started to be heavly commericalized. Many might not have noticed, but in early 2000, as computing became a mainstream part of life, and with the introduction of the internet, certain social aspects associated with the golden age of home computers started to die off. An era that was filled with creativity, community and independence suddenly lost its appeal. What happened?  

For my part, I became interested in computing to tell stories about the future of humantiy. My main interests were in the graphical capabililities of home computers but I also have an interest in sound, programming and visual art. Looking back, I realized I didn't want to be pinned down by just one discipline, so I chose to explore many different aspects of computer technology. Field specialization has strengths, but it also has weaknesses.

It seems like our educational systems are focus soely on the theoretical applications of technology. In my view, more practical learning is needed in the world. The theoretical, controlled environment approach to learning is killing us as a species.

The birth of this article started out with the intention of leaving something behind about my life and my younger years for my family. I realized while writing this that maybe I have something to say to a larger audience. As I was growing up, I somehow learned to think an act in an independent way. This got me into trouble with authority figures, but as a grew into adulthood I always felt empowered by independent study of interesting subjects and my parents where always supportive of my way of learning.  They did their best not to limit freedom of expression within their means. Exploring my own interests free from (at least to a larger extent) societal conditioning created this gap in my life that has allowed me to see the world in a slightly nuanced way.

This article is part biographical, part techie, and part philosophical. My hope is to bring all these parts togeather in a way that can be understood. Im glad there is a movement to preserve computer history and I hope my account can contribute to that endevor, but my primary interest is in shining a light on how technology is being used in society to create systems of control, systems that we give our power to, that attempt to take away our individual value. With knowledge comes responsibility. You have been warned.
