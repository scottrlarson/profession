As a professional computer technician, I'm responsible for addressing operational related issues with technology at the time of servicing.

Software or hardware failures can be introduced later on by bugs and changes after servicing, these bugs or changes can cause pervasive and reoccurring issues. 

When this rare situation arises, I can address these issues at a later date at my [regular rates](/#service-repair-rates-turnaround). Reoccurring issues that are attributed to the same conditions that caused the original issue, can be handled under a reduced fee (at my discretion). If the issue is closely related to the original issue from a previous servicing, I may reduce the rate in half for the second visit. Also In some cases if there is a third or forth visit, I may reduce my rate to 75% of what I originally charged.

If I intuit that an issue is going to be systemic during a servicing, I may offer a recommendation for a solution or hardware replacement, in lieu of a resolution.
