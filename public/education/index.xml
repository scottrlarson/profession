      <description>I am interested in training an apprentice in my field. If you, or someone you know, are/is interested in an in-depth understanding of how hardware and software computer technology works to be able to troubleshoot your own computer problems, or build your own computer, this apprenticeship opportunity is for you.
This is a very special arrangement for a student, or an adult that is willing to learn new ideas in how to provide a successful Computer Repair or Information Technology service.</description>
