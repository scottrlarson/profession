      <title>Password Managers</title>

      <description>Here is my recommendations for Password Managers. I look for solutions that are cross-platform, reliable, and since many of them store your private information on a cloud service, the provider needs to have good security practices. Also, the password manager should not have too many features that complicate the use and performance of the solution. The solution should also have the ability to sync your passwords in an encrypted form to a 3rd party cloud service, instead of including its own cloud solution.</description>

      <title>NoScript Web Browser Plugin</title>

      <description>NoScript provides essential protection for Firefox, and other Mozilla-based browsers. Most web browsers, by default, do not give you the option to customize what kind of web site content you want to be viewed in your browser. This causes major problems because sites often use 3rd party code to insert multimedia content and ads. Many of these 3rd parties can be compromised resulting in your computer becoming a victim of a security attack.</description>
