- All my services are guaranteed to be free of mistakes in servicemanship. 
- Any device purchased from me that has parts containing a replacement guarantee from the manufacturer, also carries my 1 year labor replacement warranty from the day of purchase.

{{% alert title="Software support is usually outside of the scope of my Service Guarantee" %}}If you request software or a service to be setup, maintained, or repaired on your device/s, and you require support during or after my servicing, I may be required to interact with the software or service provider to resolve the issue. In addition, if a change was made post-service, that caused the issue, I might be required to undue or resolve those changes. In both cases, you may incur additional charges. {{% /alert %}}
