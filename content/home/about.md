{{% alert title="I stand with Ukraine" %}} I support any people's right to freedom and sovereignty from repressive colonial systems through non-cooperation. Please speak out against tyranny in your own way as we all share this Earth. Using violence, or the threat of violence, to subjugate a people for political gain, or any other reason, is unacceptable. Humans were born with the right to be free from oppression.{{% /alert %}}

{{% accordion title="Current Services" col="in" id="services" %}}
I provide computer repair services at my office in <a href="#contact">downtown</a> Santa Rosa. When I am not repairing computers at my office, I devote some of my free operation time to home and office visits for individuals and small business (5 employees or less). I troubleshoot and offer recommendations on computer technologies related to productivity and entertainment. I also design and performance-tune hardware for gamers and creative artists that use computers for entertainment and professional productions. I also setup and configure desktops and workstations for office work.

{{% alert title="2023 OEM Computer Servicing Changes" url="/updates/update-deceptive-design-recent-computers-laptops/" %}}Orginal Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) recently have been making design changes to there products that impact my services to you. **If you plan on upgrading to, or purchasing a new computer**, I will recommend a custom-made computer, instead of an OEM Computer that you purchase from a computer store.

  Once you’ve paid money for a product, the manufacturer shouldn’t be able to dictate how you use it—it’s yours. Ownership means you should be able to open, hack, repair, upgrade, or tie bells on it.
