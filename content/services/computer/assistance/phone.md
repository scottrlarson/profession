{{% contact-info %}}
Check my [hours](/#contact) for availability. I offer a free evaluation of your issue. In this evaluation, I use my 20+ years of experience to visually inspect your device and make a educated guess on the cause. This helps you decide whether diagnosing or repairing your issue is worth your time. Please understand that many issues require a full diagnostic of the hardware or the software. If you have a question about technology, you can consult with me over the phone or through an in-office visit. In this case I give you 20mins of my time to understand your issue. If you want more information about my project based services you can visit the [Repairs](/services/computer/repair/), [Home-Office](/services/computer/home-office/), and [Multimedia/Gaming](/services/computer/multimedia-gaming/) sections of my website. For information on the costs of these services, check my [rates](/#rates) section. If you have a question, please [contact](/#contact) me.
