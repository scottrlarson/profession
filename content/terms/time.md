During the evaluation period, I will do my best to communicate to you the length of time a service might require. With certain technical problems the length of time to diagnose or repair can range from a couple hours, days, or even weeks depending on the issue, and the time may change depending on what crops up during the servicing. If you cannot be without your device for the length of time specified during the servicing, ask about acquiring a replacement,  or loaner device. If my loaner stock is available, I can lend you a device until the work is complete. If you require access to your personal, or business data, it will need to be transferred to the loaner device at my data transfer rates. Depending on the amount of data, that sometimes can take a few hours to a day to transfer.
