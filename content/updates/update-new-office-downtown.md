Update: The pictures below are out of date, but I am right next door in the "Upton" building. As 2019 3/1/2019 I am now at 555 5th Street Suite 230-A. Pictures will go up when I am finished furnishing my new office.

I have a new office downtown on 5th Street. I share an office building with about 5 other service professionals. My locked office is in the back of the building. This is where I fix devices and perform data recovery. I also consult with the public on a wide variety of solutions from disaster recovery to security and device maintenance. Come say hi, or bounce an idea off me Monday though Saturday 8am to 6pm. Just ring the door bell or shoot me a text or call at 707-416-5811 and I will greet you at the door.
