<h1>Divestment</h1>

<p><em>Submitted by Scott Larson on Tue, 05/02/2017 - 2:14pm</em></p>

<p>Government should only play a limited role in our lives by operating at our request to take care of the resources that we use to survive. The U.S government is operating totally outside of its mandate. To return to a healthy form of government consider limiting your role in its expansion by:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="">Recognizing who you are in relationship to government though education.</a></li>
<li>Doing what you can to limit or remove your support in any system that does not operate for the benefit of mankind.</li>
<li>Doing what you can to educate others in what you have done to alter your relationship with government and support others where possible in helping them alter their relationship with government. </li>
</ol>

<p>The best way to stop an abuse or corruption is to stop supporting it in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take responsibility in its creation, by recognizing your ignorance of, or participation in it with your money, time or energy.</li>
<li>Do what you can in your own life to remove your support.</li>
<li>Do what you can to bring awareness to others by letting them know your part in its creation and what you have done to remove your support.</li>
</ol>

<h3>DIVEST INSTEAD OF PROTEST</h3>

<p>Petitioning or Protesting a malicious entity sets up the dynamic of putting the petitioners or the protesters in the role of a vicim and the malicious entity in the role of perpetrator. In order to really bring change your actions have to change.  Protesting sends a message that you are expecting change without you doing any actual work. </p>

<p>Protesting is not as powerful as refusing to support an establishment who is harming you or your fellow man. Refusing to support or consent to an evil actor cuts that actor off from acting against you or your fellow man by removing the resources it uses to act. </p>

<p>If you want to bring real change you need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pool together resources from your community participants that you can use to circumvent the malicious entity by taking control of it&#39;s source of supply and demand.</li>
<li>Stop investing resources into the malicious entity: Time, Money or Energy.
Bring awareness of the divestment strategy and its successes to your community.</li>
<li>This actually happened in Boliva, Mcdonalds withdrew from the country entirely  when the people refused to purchase the product.. This is all you need to do.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your divestment strategy becomes a target through criminal actions of state or federal government officials and they are operating completley outside of their mandate by detaining divesters for divestment actions, you might need to put the man or women who is interfering with your actions on <a href="">notice</a> with <a href="">fee schedule</a> and <a href="">bring that man or women into a court of record</a>. <a href="">You need to know how to defense your rights</a>. <a href="">If you use the current administrative courts to try and obtain remedy with a lawyer, you are submitting yourself to a judicial system that is not within your control</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Henry%20Thoru">Politics is a lazy mans game</a>. Its for people that dont want to take an active approach to making the world a better place. Also it has the effect of putting some politician in your place as your mouth piece. Durring the beginning of civiliation the only people that were allowed to have mouth pieces are the insane and mentally unstable since they didn&#39;t know how to speak and act for themselves. So the question is, are you insane or mentiall unstable? If the answer is yes stay right where you are and let someone else take charge of your life until you are ready to assume control without getting involved in poiltical movments. If the answer is no then what the hell have you been doing all this time? <a href="Widraw%20Consent">Get out from under the state you put yourself in and act</a>.</p>

<p>When you vote, or get involved in politics you are signaling to the world that you are not competent enough to speak and act for yourself. And this system of government treats you exactly like a kid that needs a nanny.</p>

<p>When you are ready to become an adult and start righting wrongs yourself with the help of the community by not allowing yourself to be manipulated by systems of control like political parties, government and academic institutions you can join the rest of us who have broken free of this illusion and are starting to be a part of making the world a better place.</p>

<p>Remember you can never win by playing the role of a victim. Stop letting society dictate to you your range of responses to any unjust act. You have to act from a place of power if you want any real change to happen, and you need to inform yourself and others so that you can act from this place of power.</p>

<h3>Support Community Projects that focus on Decentralizing Power</h3>

<p>The more centralization there is of decision making the harder it is to make real change. Support people and projects with goals of shifting decision making into local communities.</p>
