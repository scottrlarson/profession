<p>I am one person with many customers, I will do my best to keep you up to date on the length of time a service might require, but certain circumstances can cause the work length to be different than what I originally specified, or more than you can bear.  Service time to completion can range from a couple hours, days, or even weeks depending on the issue. I am not responsible for the results of work taking longer than expected when those circumstance are out of my hands. If you need access to a device while the work is being performed I have loaner equipment. If my loaner stock is available I can lend you a device until the work is complete. Ask me about my loaner stock if you require this service.</p>
