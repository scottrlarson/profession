From a technology and culture perspective This piece is a look at where we have been, and where we are heading as a society. This article is a companion piece to "Reflections on the Home Computer Golden Age". 
[TOC]

Computers and tinkering has been my forte since I was a kid. Today I am a computer hardware and software troubleshooter. I run my own computer repair service and for over 20 years I have been providing technical assistance to home users and very small businesses. 

This biography is my personal take on the evolution of the Home Computer. A Home Computer is one of the first computers that were designed for the home which eventually created the [technology revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_revolution) we see today. 

This piece is for people interested in the evolution and the social impact of computer technology. Even though I have some schooling in my past, my interests lie in the non-academic parts of life and my primary mode of learning is self-education. From my standpoint, while growing up during the home computer revolution, the computer hacking scene really began in late eighties and ended abruptly in the early nineties. In early 2000, as computing became a mainstream part of life, and with the introduction of the internet, certain social aspects associated with the home computer world started to die off. An era that was filled with creativity, community and independence.  During this era, I became mainly interested in graphics and design when many of my friends chose programming. But looking back, I realized I didn't want to be pinned down by just one discipline, so I chose to explore many different aspects of computer technology. Field specialization has strengths, but it also has weaknesses. 


This quote from Motoko Kusanagi (Ghost in the Shell (1995)) says it all: 

> “If we all reacted the same way, we'd be predictable, and there's always more than one way to view a situation...It's simple: overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It's slow death.” 

I take a philosophical approach to how technology is impacting the world from a sociological perspective. I also touch on how technology is evolving and how this evolution impacts the way we relate each other. 

Today, most of what is taught in schools is limited and theoretical, and in my view, more practical learning is needed in the world. The theoretical, controlled environment approach to learning is killing us as a species.

The birth of this biography started out with the intention of leaving something behind about my life and my younger years for my family. But then I realized that maybe I have something to say to a larger audience. Growing up, my parents supported my independent nature. Being free to explore my world and not being pinned down (at least to a larger extent) by societal conditioning created this gap in my life that has allowed me to see the world in a slightly different way then you might be accustom to. 

This account is part biographical, part techie, and part philosophical. My hope is to share my experiences with others who are interested in computer history, but also to inspire readers to look closely at systems of control that we give our power to that attempt to take away our individual value. With knowledge comes responsibility. You have been warned.
