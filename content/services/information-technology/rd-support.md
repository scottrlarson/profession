I specialize in resolving workstation software and hardware issues. And with today's latest remote desktop technology, much of this can be handled online, over the internet. If you are struggling with an application glitch, or you have a workstation that is misbehaving, I can diagnose, provide recommendations and/or resolve and repair problems that might slow, or completely halt your productivity.
