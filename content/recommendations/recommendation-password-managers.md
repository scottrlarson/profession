Here is my recommendations for [Password Managers](/terms/term-password-manager). I look for solutions that are [cross-platform](/terms/term-cross-platform), reliable, and since many of them store your private information on a [cloud service](/terms/term-cloud-service), the provider needs to have good security practices. Also, the password manager should not have too many features that compliate the use and performance of the solution. The solution should also have the ability to sync your passwords in an [encrypted](/terms/term-encryption) form to a 3rd party cloud service, instead of including its own cloud solution. This is so you can access and sync your passwords across multipule devices, and not have all of your eggs in one basket. Similar to investing, this pratice spreads your risk across multipule solutions, minimzing the impact on your life if the provider ever happens to change their polcies, or suffer outages. I have also found that all-in-one products tend to be very loose when it comes to privacy. In my experience, combining the software into a service, sold by the same company is to prevent the user from controlling their own information. And you will see that in their pirvacy statment.
