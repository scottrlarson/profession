Computers and tinkering has been my forte since I was a kid. Today I am a computer hardware and software troubleshooter. I run my own computer repair service and for over 20 years I have been providing technical assistance to home users and very small businesses. 

This biography is my personal take on the evolution of the Home Computer. A Home Computer is one of the first computers that were designed for the home which eventually created the [technology revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_revolution) we see today. 

This piece is for people that have an interest in a personal account on aspects of computer technology from a self-educated, non-academic perspective from a kid who was involved in the computer hacking scene in the eighties and nineties. Instead of becoming a programmer, I chose to explore the many aspects of computer technology. Field specialization has strengths, but it also has weaknesses. 

This quote from Motoko Kusanagi (Ghost in the Shell (1995)) says it all: 

> “If we all reacted the same way, we'd be predictable, and there's always more than one way to view a situation...It's simple: overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It's slow death.” 

I take a philosophical approach to how technology is impacting the world from a sociological perspective. I also touch on how technology is evolving and how this evolution impacts the way we relate each-other. I did not go to school to learn this stuff, its all been hands-on, from a personal exploratory approach. Today, most of what is taught in schools is limited and theoretical, and in my view, we need more practical learning. The theoretical, controlled environment approach to learning is killing us as a species.

The birth of this biography started out with the intention of leaving something behind about my life and my younger years for my family. But I realized that maybe I have something to say to a larger audience. Being free to explore my world from my own interests and not being pinned down (at least to a larger extent) by societal conditioning created this gap in my life that has allowed me to see the world in a slightly different way then you might be accustom to. Its part biographical, part techie, and part philosophical. My hope is to share my experiences with others who are interested in computer history, but also to inspire people to look closely at systems of control that show up in our every day life that attempt to take away our individual value. With knowledge comes responsibility. You have been warned.

My first experience with computers started in the early 1980's on one of the first home computers, the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A. I was about 12 years old. Relatively expensive, but affordable to average person, Home Computers ranged around a thousand dollars in value.

Due to the expense, not many families had a personal computer back then. Fortunately we had a friend who's mother must have saw the value in kids playing with computers and had the resources to purchase one for her son. The reasons why I will never know as I lost contact with them. "**Tunnels of Doom**" became the hot title at the time. As far as I know, it was the first multi-player turn-based [dungeon crawler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_crawl) released at that time. We started our morning loading in the cassette and pushing the play button so the computer could read our previous save game data from the weekend before. After several hours and a home cooked dinner our game would be loaded. We each took our respective turns exploring a procedurally generated dungeon together, engaging in battles with monsters and restoring fallen comrades. I remember it being the first continuous game experience that would last more than one sitting where I learned to cooperate with other players to complete objectives.

A few years after my experience with the TI994a. My parents notice my enthusiasm in science and computers. I think they wanted to turn me into a scientist and saw the home computer as a step up from my childhood dream of getting myself into trouble. 

A quick side note, I had brief introduction into electronics theory and practicalities by my Uncle Jim, who worked as a electrician in WWII, and later became a city electrician. On occasion, when my parents went away on vacation, they would ship me to Chicago to visit my Uncle. He showed me the basics of the apprentice craft. A few years of my life was spent in his basement, building small electronic devices together. Maybe that's why I jump at the prospect of getting my hands on newly released gadgets today.  

As far as electronics go, the computer was, and is, a different beast. Obviously, the inner workings of a computer operates on the same principles of electric current. But what made home computers different from electronics is the software programming aspect of it. Programming is like creating a list of instructions for something to happen. When a computer receives a list of instructions, at the end of the day, is really all about flipping switches. Flipping a sequence of switches actually, in a way the computer can understand.

Anyways, this enthusiasm got me my first computer, a Commodore 64. I'm skipping the part where my real first computer was a TRS-80. Because, well, if you didn't know, back then, it was considered the [Trash 80](https://dfarq.homeip.net/trash-80-what-it-meant-and-why-it-stuck/) by my compadres, and I don't want to mar my reputation :P. It was as good of a computer as any during that time, but since it was sold by Radio Shack, I think it developed a bad reputation because Radio Shack's electronics were considered subpar.

Anyways, forget I ever said anything about that. On to the extraordinary achievement of the mid-eighties. I bring you, the Commodore 64!

### Commodore 64

Commodore, instrumental in launching the Home Computer movement forward focused on low cost alternatives to the high end, high price market that the juggernauts Apple and IBM were involved in at the time. [Commodore's decisions around the development of the Home Computer launched many innovations forward that made the computer entertainment industry what it is today.](https://www.bitmapbooks.com/blogs/news/back-to-basic-understanding-the-dazzling-legacy-of-the-commodore-64)

The C64 was my first computer, if you were using computers at the time, it was likely your first computer to. Simplicity, low cost, superior graphics, quality sound, good game software and aggressive marketing made the C64 the perfect home computer for enthusiasts like me and many others.

Tinkering communities formed around the C64's simple design and broad software support. It was a bit like the cassette tape area. Enthusiasts like me became fascinated with exploring and tinkering with the C64's capabilities by testing the limits of hardware, writing software that does cool things and sharing it with the community.

But the major selling point of the C64 was the low cost for the individual that wanted to design their own programs and games. Back then, designing software was dominated by large companies that either sold software to big business, or manufactures of coin-operated games.

It put the power to create something cool into the hands of regular people. The C64 inspired a whole slew of independent software designed for people who wanted to share their creations.

Like the first mission to the moon, the technology behind the Amiga 500 Home Computer changed everything. The A500 had it's beginnings at Atari. An engineer, Jay Miner, had an idea to develop a computer that would revolutionize games and make them much easier to develop. Too afraid of losing money, corporate executives put no energy into innovation causing the industry to collapse. At the time game development relied heavily on licensing expensive hardware developed by 3rd parties. Due to the fear of losing these deals, Atari prohibited Jay from perusing this new platform. Jay left Atari, and a previous co-worker helped him revive the idea under a new company. Eventually Commodore bought the platform and the Amiga 500 became bit hit with computer enthusiasts but most importantly with people in the music and video entertainment professions who saw the A500's multimedia features as revolutionary. 

The Amiga platform used one of the first [Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface). In the C64 days, the computer received instructions from a Command Line Interface (CLI). (I.E typing commands to launch programs and work with everyday tasks). There were some limited GUI interfaces back then, but nothing on the scale that the A500 had. It's difficult to quantify the impact the GUI had on my life. Switching between a life time of using CLI, to a GUI is like miraculously being able to see after years of being blind. The way in which a computer is used is like an extension of perception. As humans, we interact with our environment by the senses. Interacting with a computer is an extension between the mind and body. The more intuitive the tool, the more fluid and imaginative one can be with the tool, and this interaction impacts how we perceive the world around us. 

For many people that might have been put-off by command line, GUI's made using computers more intuitive to use and helped spawned a golden age of digital art and sound. When the first 3d modeling software was released for the A500, I was one of the first adopters of it.

It sported a new development called "Open Achictechure". A first for computer enthusiasts, similar to the concept of modularity, parts could be removed, replaced and upgraded.


> ‘We need to build computers for the masses, not the classes.‘ was Commodore’s founder Jack Tramiel’s motto.




#### The days of Future Wars and Another World
**Commodore Amiga games that influenced my life**

With the release of the Amiga platform, games started springing up with amazing graphics and sound. Beyond anything I experienced before, the capibilities of these features ignighting my imagination with possibitlies. Eventually my gaming experience on the Amiga platform inspired me to invest my time and energy into 3D modeling and graphic design.

![Future Wars](/img/memorials/games/delphine-software/future-wars/futurewars-cover.jpg)
In my early twenties I develop an interest in Time travel after reading a book on Temporal Mechanics. So when the adventure game, **Future Wars** came out on the Amiga Platform I was as ecstatic as a hobbit in a pie shop. Future Wars might not have been an amazing success like other games at the time, but I love expoloring the concept of time and doing so in a game that sported such amazing graphics and sound, made possible by the Amiga platform, helped me to continue to explore my interests in science .

## This is Now

### Custom built Computers
I currently build my own computers (Assemble from hardware on the market), but I also repair OEM computers as well.

#### x64 Operating Systems
**Linux**
**Windows**

#### Current software I utilize
I'm a avid supporter of open source software, especially with Microsoft and Apple software. These companies create whats called "[Walled Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform)", anti-competitive approaches to their respective operating systems. For the average customer of computer products, it might not be a visible issue, but lately operating systems are being subtlety designed more and more to prevent choice. You can read more about this delima in my article "[My transition from Windows to Linux in an anti-customer age](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-transition-windows-to-linux/)" (I still service computers that have Windows, but I no longer use Windows as my everyday driver).

I used to use many closed source products for my creativity, Mainly Adobe products, but they are also creating there own ecosystems that prevent choice so I work very hard now to use software that is not owned and controlled by any one company. Its been my experience, when the profit incentive is limited in the product, development of software tends to move in a direction of enabling choice for the user. When profit motives are deeply invested in software, there seems to be a change in direction at some point to give users less choice to keep the profit margins going for investors. I have found that this stifles innovation and harms the [common good - the procedural formulations definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good). I understand profit as an end of good will, not solely a means to get a personal outcome. If the means is put before the end, that usually tends to corrupt the endeavor. "The end justifies the means" is at the heart of this problem. A heart based outcome cannot be experienced for the common good by following this philosophical standpoint.

## Conclusion

An ideological divide, created by big business hoping to capitalize on fear the fear of being different tried to control the experience of computer technology came from people that feared and widely misunderstood this movement. They passed this hysteria onto the general public through the media which caused the general public to treat this new technology with suspicion. If you were one of those "Enthusiast" kids, ridicule and shame came with the territory. During the Industrial Revolution, If you weren't doing something productive, something was wrong with you. I didn't want people to think that I was odd, so I developed a cover story to hide my computer gaming obsession by doing something constructive with "That Contraption" as people like to call them.  I learned C64 basic, the coding language at the time and speech synthesizing (Converting text into speech). If all I was doing, was playing games, I was a nobody with no future in everyone's mind.


I imagine most people at the time thought, and maybe currently think now, that computer games are peripheral to what is going on in the world. In fact, I think there was a real stigma to art and entertainment in my childhood years. Everyone in my neck of the woods seemed to want to appear like they were doing something of importance, that usually meant having a good job with some well known corporation, and making sure we appeared to be supporting capitalism. 

Some of that must have rubbed off on me, because to this day, I still feel empty if I am not doing something externally productive with my life. After reflecting on my childhood experiences with computer gaming, I realized that games, and having fun are a basic fundamental of being human. Sound, graphics, and story elements, that reflected the challenges we are facing in modern society created a real impact on my artistic direction and it helped me explore the real problems with our culture's need to [dominate other cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony). There is a great documentary on the independent gaming culture and it's positive impact on the developers of games as they were growing up called "[Gameloading: Rise of the Indies](https://gameloading.vhx.tv/videos/gameloading-stereo)". 

During this time, I was combining what I knew about electronics from my Uncle by adding modifications to my C64 peripherals. A few crude applications I can remember implementing, were to save power of my peripherals and increase the operating speed of disk drives, which usually result in read/write problems. These kinds of modifications to hardware were probably directly related to why I choose a path of building gaming computers for myself and friends when the PC platform became more modular, which eventually inspired me to start my own computer repair business.

In the early seventies, IBM was the Goliath on the Business Computer block. They had a solid sales/marketing team and were selling 5 million dollar mainframe computers to business that could afford them. Thinking that the Home Computer craze was just a fad, they didn't take the revolution seriously. For the world-at-large, the Home Computer revolution didn't start until IBM's customers pressured the company to enter the space. IBM released the first Personal Computer called the "model 5150" more commonly known as the IBM PC. Based on a open architecture design, the 5150 became very popular. Home Computers were mainly controlled by closed designs, so it's unfortunate that it took a major player to change this paradigm, which IBM used to its own advantage to dominate the Home Computer space. IBM struggled to compete with the Home Computer market, dominated by Apple, Commodore and Tandy but by then the open architecture concept changed the game completely. Home Computer companies started offer there own PC clones to stay in the game. Standards in hardware and software designed, based on the open architecture philosophy brought great innovation to the world of Computers and with it, an era of endless possibilities for the hobbyist.

To this day, Microsoft benefited the most from the IBM's decision to open its architecture, as it was chosen as the main operating system for the PC. It's interesting to note that the company is currently moving further and further into closed design territory with Windows 11. There aim appears to be removing customer choice along with the other companies that jumped on that bandwagon in later years like Apple, HP, Dell and others. Many current computer hardware manufacturers and software developers are designing static hardware and software around a [walled garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform) perspective. You can see this perspective with the push to cloud software as a service. You can read more about my thoughts around closed designs in the everyday software we use in my "[My transition from Windows to Linux in an anti-customer age](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-transition-windows-to-linux/)" article and the movement to back again to open hardware platforms in my "[Will one repairable laptop change the world?](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-future-of-repairability/)" article.
