This guide helps you outline 10 areas that you should be considering while researching a new home for your website.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Step 1:</strong>&nbsp;Website Host Recommendations</h2>
<p>First you will want to find a suitable hosting provider for your website. There are a few good hosting companies out there such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hostgator.com/">Host Gator</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/">Dream Host</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.bluehost.com/">Blue Host</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;Website Host Specifications: What to look for in a New Website Host:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating System Compatibility</strong> – It’s critical that a new host has a hosting package that supports the operating system you were previously using.&nbsp; Contact your current webhost to find out which one you’re hosting package uses and make a note.</li>
<li><strong>Support Service</strong> – Make sure they have good 24/7 technical support via Chat, Email, or Phone. Phone support is helpful during critical situations, but your needs might not require it.</li>
<li><strong>Email Capabilities</strong> − Should allow at least 20 email addresses if not unlimited, along with POP3 and SMTP abilities and enough space to support your mail. 10 gigs per mail box or more should be sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting Space</strong> – It is important to know how much space you will require (always leave room for growth). You can find out more about your space usage though your current host’s control panel, or by contacting them directly.</li>
<li><strong>Data Transfer Limits</strong> – it is important to calculate the amount of data transfer you require. Make sure you leave room for growth. Most sites need at least 2GB of data transfer per month.</li>
<li><strong>CPU Usage Limits</strong> – Depending on your site’s requirement make sure you have access to similar CPU resources. <a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/contact">Contact me</a> for more information about this</li>
<li><strong>Database Access</strong> – Make sure the new host has SQL support. The kind of SQL support will depend on the Operating System you are using with your current host.</li>
<li><strong>Scripting Capabilities</strong> – Make sure a new host has supports for the scripting language your website uses if any.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong> – Find a host that has fast servers with great connection to the Internet backbone. Make sure they have great uptime (over 99.5%) Check reviews sites for customer comments on performance.</li>
<li><strong>Control Panel</strong> – A good control panel can make life much easier. Control panels vary depending on the host and you will find some or better than others. Cpanel is a standard now and very accessible.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Step 3: Webs</strong>ite Backup</h2>
<p>Another very critical step is to have a backup of all your website, database and email data.</p>
<p>There are a few steps to back up your data: Most hosts have a backup tool you can use to save home director to then FTP the backup file to yourself.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can also use FTP program to log into your home directory and download your home folder directly, which takes longer than doing a site backup.</li>
<li>Use a website publishing application to transfer your site’s home directory to your local computer.</li>
<li>Download your mail if your using IMAP. IMAP stores mail on the server. If you switch hosts before transferring your mail to your new host, when you cancel your old service you will lose your mail. <a href="http://www.mailstore.com/en/mailstore-home.aspx">MailStore</a> is good application to do this on a PC. If you have trouble trying to make this happen due to the amount of mail or the complicated nature of it you can <a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/schedule-appointment">schedule an appointment</a> with me to do the <a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/e-mail-transfer">email transfer</a> for you.</li>
<li>Make sure you backup your mail settings, forwards and aliases from your host’s Cpanel.</li>
</ol>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Step 4: </strong>Sign-up, Maintain Both Your Old and New Website Host during the Migration and Testing Stages</h2>
<p>Assuming you found a host that you like; you can now sign up with your new host. Most hosts have a 30 or 60 day money back guarantee, which should be enough time to determine wither you like their service. Here are a few things that will come along with your new set up.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should be given an IP address.</li>
<li>A login &amp; password (you will want to change your password to make it your own)</li>
<li>Name server information (primary and secondary)</li>
<li>Links to your control panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to make copies of all this information in a safe place.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 5: </strong>Upload Site</h2>
<p>After you sign-up for service you then need to upload your website to the new host using your preferred transfer method: FTP or Web Publishing Application. Configure your site links and scripts to they work on your new host.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 6: </strong>Perform Comprehensive Testing</h2>
<p>Testing your site before flipping the DNS switch is very important. Even if you have a great attention to detail, it is always a good idea to have someone else test out the new site.</p>
<ul>
<li>Check and view your newly uploaded site in your browser</li>
<li>Check all your pages to see if they mirror what is on your old host.</li>
<li>Make sure all the pages exist and the links point to the right places.</li>
<li>Check all your forms and check all your scripts (many scripts will require editing) It is recommended using a link checker after you do all the manual testing. Good link checkers will let you know of possible broken links and should help you fix them. You will want to run your link checker again after switching hosts.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Step 7:</strong> Prepare Your New Email accounts:</h2>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss any email messages during the transition; you may want to set up your new email account right away. It is important that you make sure you are still able to access your old email account at the time because you might receive email message at both for 2-4 days. If you are using autoresponders, forwarding or aliases, you can set those up in your control panel. If you had previous mailing list functionality on your old host, you will want to export all the contacts and populate your new mailing list with those contracts before switching sites.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 8:</strong> Switch your DNS Name Service to your new Host:</h2>
<p>Finally you can flip the virtual switch! The key to switching the web hosts is your DNS information. The key to changing your DNS information is the registrar for you domain name. The switch will usually take 24-72 hours to be recognized by servers across the world. It may take a full week for the smaller more remote servers to recognize the change. If you ae using a new domain name, you will want to put up a link to the site on your old host and keep the old host account for a couple of months</p>
<h2><strong>Step 9:</strong> Cancel Old Website Host</h2>
<p>After you have successfully made your move it would be a good time to cancel your old account. It is recommended that you keep your account at least one a month after the DNS change. You will need to make sure you follow your old host cancelations and instructions closely. It’s usually better to keep your current hosting company in the dark until after the DNS changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Step 10</strong>: Check Scripts &amp; Links</h2>
<p>Once the DNS changes take effect and your site domain name is pointing your current site, it might be time to check your scripts again. It is always a good idea to run a link checker after the move is complete. If you changed your domain name or didn’t have one, you will want to notify any site linking to you.</p>
