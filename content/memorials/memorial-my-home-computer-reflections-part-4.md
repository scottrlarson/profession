From a technology and culture perspective This piece is a look at where we have been, and where we are heading as a society. This article is a companion piece to "Reflections on the Home Computer Golden Age". 

[TOC]

The Amiga platform brought amazing capabilities in visuals and sound, beyond anything I experienced. The games created during this time ignited my imagination with possibilities. 

My gaming experience on the Amiga platform inspired me to invest my time and energy into graphic design.  When the first 3D modeling software was released for the Amiga Platform, I was one of it's first adopters. Later in life, this field engaged my interest in film and finally writing for film. 

## Amiga games that influenced my life
**The days of Future Wars, Another World & Flashback**

![Future Wars](/img/memorials/games/delphine-software/future-wars/futurewars-cover.jpg)

In 1989 I played **Future Wars**, a science fiction adventure game release on Amiga Platform. Not a big fan of adventure games at the time, I was more interested in the science fictional aspects of the story telling. 

Future Wars might not have been an amazing success like other games at the time, but I love exploring the concept of time travel. What really inspired me about the game is the sound, made possible by the Amiga platform. Sound was a big thing for games back then, which was very limited by the hardware. For some reason, sound and story telling helped me to continue to explore my interests in science, leading to interpersonal contemplation of what the future might be like. Great for my own story telling as I developed an interest in writing for film. I developed an interest in temporal mechanics and cognitive theory, both of which helps shape my understanding of of the world today. The subjects I write about all have their roots in how objective reality and perception has effects on the human mind.

Three years later **Another World** came out. I was in a game store of the time. I picked up this title and looked at the front and back cover. It looked something like this:

The idea of some guy lost and stranded on a foreign planet resonated with me. Probably because I feel that way some times on earth :P. Anyway, it was the first time I saw three dimensional perspective used in a game. Later I found out the developer used rotoscoping to create the cut-scenes. Remember this is a 2d scrolling game mind you. If my memory serves me correctly, 3D perspective in 2d scrolling games was something not even considered at the time.

A few years later, **Flashback**, a game by the same publisher was released that had a similar feel to Another World, but in it's own right, it was its own game. The game followed a similar theme that I was attracted to, A single protagonist, stranded somewhere, must find his way back to himself.

Flashback Soundtrack

Both Another World and Flashback had great instrumental sound tracks. Not only did music, espically music with atmosphiric sound effects  helped me focus on whats happening in the game, it so helps me connect with my surroundings and from that point on, I used music to help me focus on my creativity which seems to steam atmospheric sounds.

Playing these particular games was the first time I experienced liner story telling and that helped me figure out why I was so inspired by stories. I realized that story telling, in the way it was presented in games, as interactive pieces, was a way for me to focus my own decision making in life. As a learned how to make descision in games, I realized with the right focus and intention, I could make sound choices in my own life.

[The Fallout 3 Ambient Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWgXz2PRrTk) is a perfect example of how ambmiance can focus attention 

### Commodore Amiga 2000

Realizing the power of the Amiga platform for graphics and sound I wanted to do more with the technology that just play games. So I purchased an Amiga 2000 with some inheritance money I had to explore the cutting edge capabilities of the platform. 

As Commodore shifted gears with the marketing strategies to appeal directly to business by releasing a model for Graphic Artists. In the early 1990's the [Video Toaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Toaster) was release and this is where people really started to take notice of the platform. The toaster allowed you to combine graphic capabilities with real world captured video, something TV stations were moving toward anyway. Before the release of the Toaster a TV station would spend 10,000 on hardware to make this dream a reality. But now, it was being put into the hands of independent artists. This move spawned a whole new era of creative markets.

### 3D modeling on the Amiga 2000

My interests in 3d modeling and animation (Now called special effects) centered around the work behind the games Another World and Flashback. I purchased an Amiga 2000 solely for that purpose. **Caligari** which was later renamed to **Truespace 3d** was the application at the time designed for this purpose. 

I wanted to recreate in 3d what I saw in those 2d side scrolling games.

{{< caption-image url="/img/memorials/models/rylon-head.png.jpg" title="My rendition of the Another World Creature" >}}


After realizing Caligari's capabilities, I thought I might get into 3D graphic design, so I purchased the Amiga 2000. I was in collage at the time taking various courses in art/design to see where my interests would take me.

Knowing that special effects would become future of film and other forms of creative projects, being apart of this movement would be important for my artistic development. But when I saw the kind of work environments that were created around these industries, the long work hours and the effects corporate culture had on the people that were already in these industries, I decided to take the road of independence. The knowledge I had at the time, making electronics work and maintaining them was more marketable as a one man show. Besides, I didn't really work well with others at the time. In hindsight, the judgments I made about the world, stunted my artistic growth. Or at least the impact I might have made on society by being apart of something bigger than what my own mind could imagine. 


But learning learning this field in isolation helped me shape my ideas and bring some of my ideas to life, which inspired me to get into writing for film, instead of creating works of art that revolved around the creations of others.

But creating my own individual works of art has been difficult for me because I chose isolation over working with others.

#### Bulletin Board System (BBS) & The Modem

In the 1980's we dialed-up computers to leave something about us behind for the next caller.  One call after the other, users imprinted themselves upon the walls of life in this early digital stratosphere.  Before the Internet became a reality, BBS systems were our knowledge centers. Built by the users, for the users, of the users. 

I became a user of BBS's during my early C64 days, I was around 13 years of age.  Probably because my parents where in the process of splitting up, I sometimes found it hard to reign in my emotions and be civil. At the time, I found myself in trouble with the social contracts on some of the BBS's I was a member of. Back then, codes of conduct still applied in the digital world and I would find my account suspended for a time which tended to cut me off from online socialization.

But I got on with life and grew up somewhat. After awhile, I purchased a Commodore 128 and ran my own BBS and becaome my own SysOP (Systems Operator).  


If you were a SysOp at the time, you had a unique glimpse into the future of online communication, which is different that person-to-person. Because of the time we were in, society was still in its early stages of individual expression. Much of our way of life was effected by social mores and peer pressure to maintain a facade of being something everyone expected you to be. To fit into society, that's what we did, at least in America. But as an early SysOP, I noticed that BBS users would drop these disguises and reveal who they truly were, or at least who they wanted to be.

Maybe this understanding started me down the path of being able to remain authentic to who I was even under extreme pressure from the outside world.

The early BBS's were the first type of systems where there was real interaction between people online, way before the internet. Connecting and sharing your innermost dreams happened at a turtle's pace because only one person was able to connect to a BBS at a time. It was unique because you could leave something behind of yourself in a post, and someone might comment on your post hours or days later. It helped me develop my thoughts about the world in a slow and methodical way which sometimes I think we lack in the modern era.

BBS's continued to be used during the revolution of the Amiga platform. Although I vaguely remember any significant changes to BBS systems after the C64/128 days, except for the multi-user communication aspect which I lost touch with for a time, not much seemed to change. Being a SysOP helped me connect with other people that had similar interests. I met to people that were as much into computers as I was, and it was great to have people to talk about our similarities. 

There was this feeling of strangers working together make the world a better place and to create cool things. It was the beginning and in some ways, the end of an era, all at once.

## The fall of Commodore

At the end of the 1980's Commodore, as a company, was struggling to keep up with the technological advancements being made by the competition. Commodore's corporate internal problems prevented them from making the innovations necessary to stay ahead. You can read more about that in the Ars Series "[History of the Amiga](https://arstechnica.com/series/history-of-the-amiga/)". Eventually Apple and the PC clones of the world started to catch up to our little alternate reality. I remember that the platform wasn't evolving. Software development was be being limited by the available hardware at the time. Getting tired of waiting for Commodore to get it's act together, I switched over to a PC platform and never looked back, until now.
