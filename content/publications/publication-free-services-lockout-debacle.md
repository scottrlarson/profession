Many criminal activities are moving online. The cost of cybercrime is predicted to reach 8 trillion in 2023 and for the next five years its going to increase by 15%. Some main targets will be account holders of free online services like Gmail, but other services will also be effected. These free services store a lot of information about you, that's why these services are free, you are the product. 

To protect the data they have about you, many services are strengthening their security measures. Many of these security solutions are so pervasive that even though they deter hackers, they also preventing account holders from gaining access to their accounts. One example is tying a mobile phone number to the account that requires text messaging service to send you codes to gain access to your account. If you switch mobile number's, what then?  If the service doesn't recognize you, or you forget your password, how will you gain access to your account if there is nobody at these services to reach out when things go wrong? 

With the new password and 2factor security requirements that continue to be improved and changed, it's easy to get locked out of your account.


Services like Email is important. Continued access to it is vital for continued welbeing. More and more of our daily life is dependant on access to these important systems and important things are worth paying for. You can purchase a paid email hosting package for around $50 a year with a direct line of support to an actual human.

Free online security measures are only going to continue to get more complex in the future, you need a reliable service provider to depend on when things go wrong.

If you're using free products as your primary services, don't wait for this to happen to you, [contact me](/#contact) to talk about a paid service migration path.
