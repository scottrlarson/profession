Any equipment left behind for over a period of 120 days from the date of service will be destroyed/recycled. You agree that any equipment you leave behind may be sold to cover any outstanding payments not received within 60 days of the date of invoicing. All Personal Data will be irrevocably destroyed to protect your privacy. I will make every effort to contact you, but if I am not able to reach you or you do not respond within this time frame regardless of the reason, I am assuming you do not want whatever equipment you have left behind and your equipment will be irrevocably destroyed/sold to cover costs and you will not be able to get your equipment back.
Privacy

**In-Shop/Office Service**

When you have me service your device. I take precautions to protect your data by working on your device in a private room and I will be the only tech that handles your device. I will only access data areas that you have asked me to work on and will not go skimming though your data that is outside the scope of what I need to analyze/repair.
Remote Service or At-location Service

During the servicing of your device I may have to access certain areas of your file system that might contain private information. I will not take any action that involves breaching the privacy to your digital information in any way.

I take every effort within my ability to secure the communications and my locations that I service devices at. This does not mean that someone with a strong motive could piggy back on my communications or my physical location to invade your privacy. If that ever happens you agree not to hold me responsible for another's actions.

**Data Loss and Damage**

When you have me service a device, I am not responsible for data loss/theft under any circumstances. I am also not responsible for damage to hardware that results from wear and tear. If there is loss or damage to your device due to my actions or inactions I will compensate you up to 2,000 dollars. I do not have insurance for any outcome that involves your the loss of your device or your data.
