<p>Any equipment left behind for over a period of 120 days from the date of service will be destroyed/recycled. Depending on my time constraints, I will make an effort to contact you, even though I am not required to. This may involve all of the following during this 120 day period: a few calls, an email, a text message, and a post letter. If I am not able to reach you, or you do not respond to any of my communications within this time frame, regardless of the reason, I am assuming you do not want whatever equipment you have left behind, and your equipment will be irrevocably destroyed/sold to cover any costs. I will do my best to secure wipe your data to protect your privacy, but I am not liable for any results that occur from any kind of breach to your personal data from devices that are in my care even though I excel at protecting your data while your device is in my care.
