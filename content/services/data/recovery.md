Depending on the storage device: Hard Disk Drive or Solid State Storage, and the state of the device itself, or if data was deleted / wiped I can usually recover that data. I will need to perform a free analysis on the device itself to let you know the possibility and expense of the recovery.

- Data Recovery Turn-Around times can vary from 1 day to 3 weeks depending on my time constraints, and the state of the device itself. If there is physical damage on the device, the particular damage may significantly slow the recovery time.
- I offer a recovery guarantee. You only pay if I can recover the data you need actually need.



## Supported Storage Devices

- Hard Disk Drive
- Solid State Storage
