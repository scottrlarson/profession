## Password/System Recovery

If you are unable to access your device, or data, I can help you gain access the to data, or equipment. 

You must own the equipment, or have power of attorney to act on the owners behalf. I will need documentation confirming that you purchased the equipment, or a document stating that you have authority to act on behalf of the owner to allow me to service the equipment.
