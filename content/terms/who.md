I provide technical service solely to individuals. If you own a business or you work for a business all service related dealings will be handled by you and I. If you want someone else to engage with me on a service in question on your behalf, please provide your consent in writing to allow that someone to speak for you and act on your behalf.

When you request a service from me, recurring or otherwise, it is by contract. Please note that any arrangement between us is two party. You [Customer] and I [Service Man]. As such, if I provide a service to you that results in an exchange of property (My services for any payment method you use to compensate me) that exchange does not include any 3rd party.
