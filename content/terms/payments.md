All payments can be made via check or cash. If you prefer to pay by credit card, you can [paypal](paypal.me/scottrlarson) me, or [venmo me](https://account.venmo.com/u/scottrlarson) at @scottRlarson. On Venmo, my handle is connected to the business part of their service. So if you do not see my listing, switch to the business tab.

## In-shop Servicing
Payments are due upon pick-up of your device.

## At-location
I require payment before I leave the location where I provide you service unless special arrangements are made for recurring service in advance (regardless of the outcome). In this case I will bill you for that service, upon receipt of a bill of service, you have two weeks to pay. 

## Online Servicing
I will bill you for this service after it's completed, upon receipt of a bill of service, you have two weeks to pay that bill.

## Notice about late or unpaid payments
There is a $1.00 fee (Per Day) for late payments. Too many late or unpaid bills will result in services being halted at a time of my discretion, or your service will be reprioritized for timely paid customers. **Repeated late or unpaid bills will result in the termination of the service relationship.**

If there are outstanding payments, I will retain your device until the service is paid. Any equipment left behind for over a period of 90 days will be destroyed/recycled. You agree that any equipment you leave behind may be sold to cover any outstanding payments to Scott Larson not received within 60 days of the date of invoicing. You understand that all personal data will be irrevocably destroyed to protect you privacy. If you leave behind a device for servicing, you understand Scott Larson will make every effort to contact you, but if you am not reachable via Phone, Email or Post within this time frame, regardless of the reason, you are giving up ownership of your equipment.
