## In-shop Servicing
Payments are due upon pick-up of your device.



## At-location
I require payment before I leave the location where I provide you service unless special arrangements are made for recurring service. In this case I will bill you for that service, upon receipt of a bill of service, you have two weeks to pay that bill.

# Online Servicing
I will bill you for this service after it's completed, upon receipt of a bill of service, you have two weeks to pay that bill.

### Notice about late payments
There is a $1.00 fee (Per Day) for late payments. Too many late or unpaid bills will result in services being halted at a time of my discretion. Repeated late or unpaid bills will result in the termination of the service relationship.
