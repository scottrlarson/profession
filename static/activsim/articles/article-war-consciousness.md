# War on Consciousness 

Psychological operations or methods used by dark occultists to cause human populations to accept untruths that distract humanity from reaching its ultimate positive potential.

## Obfuscation 

Confuses the public on general knowledge by conveying lies as conventional trues.  turn it upside down.

In psychology it is understood that human consciousness works by repetition. If the lie is big enough and repeated long enough eventually it will be believed.

> [All this was inspired by the principle—which is quite true within itself—that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie)

## Worldview Poisoning

An authority figure or many authority figures work together to promote a disunifitied view of humanity by making a specific claim using some form of media which causes the public to blame themselves in some way for a problem that the authority figure perceives and creates the perception of.  Please be aware that there may be some truth to a claim, the important point that poisons our worldview is what is offered as the remedy for the symptom. If for instance the solution is to allow a inhumane act as the remedy and the public started to believe that this remedy is the only solution then this collective belief would be considered disunifying. This causes us to turn on ourselves and prevents us from working together to relive suffering on our own terms.

Some examples of worldview poisoning are:

- The world is over populated, therefor we have to reduce the population though murdering people though the use of vaccines or geoengineering.
- The main cause climate change is human production, therefor we have to introduce regulations to isolate human populations in certain areas approved only by government.
