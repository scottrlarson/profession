{{% accordion title="Professional Background" col="in" id="professional" %}}
I am a computer and information technology professional. I got my start in technology working for small custom computer shops back in the late nineties. I then moved on to Systems Administration for small networks. Disillusioned with corporate politics, I  decided to leave that world behind and provide services directly to the public as a independent computer service professional.

{{% accordion title="Current Services" col="in" id="services" %}}
I provide computer repair services at my office in <a href="#contact">downtown</a> Santa Rosa. When I am not repairing computers at my office, I devote some of my free operation time to home and office visits for individuals and small business (5 employees or less). I troubleshoot and offer recommendations on computer technologies related to productivity and entertainment. I also design and performance-tune Gaming Desktops for hard-core and average gamers.

{{% accordion title="Spiritual Activism" id="activism" %}}
Along the way of providing technical services to the public, I noticed great suffering happening on a spiritual level between myself and the world. I realized, I could no longer sit by and watch my world be destroyed by inaction. Today I work very hard to bring my world into alignment with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1425166695/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_SDWsEb3Y4R0KV">Cosmic Spiritual Law</a> though my own personal activism. I follow strict cosmic codes that govern behavior centered around cause and effect. Every action has an equal an opposite reaction. This principle is well known to apply in physics, but it also operates in every area of life. Harm creates harm, and goodness creates goodness. There are no exceptions. The biggest problem to understanding this concept is knowing what actions cause harm, and what actions cause good. For me, this is a life journey, lived though the heart, that I take to find resolution. You can find out more about these codes from the [7 hermetic principles](https://www.amazon.com/Kybalion-Hermetic-Philosophy-Illustrated-Annotated/dp/0943217210?psc=1) which is based on the Hermetic teachings. Also I have found that the [Brotherhood of Light](https://www.light.org) to have great resources for practical learning of these principles.</p>

Spiritual Activism is the coming together of spirituality and activism. It is not about religion, it is not about any form of dogma, it is activism that comes from the heart, not just the head, activism that is compassionate, positive, kind, fierce and transformative. Being a spiritual activist means taking responsibility for my part in creating the change I want to see in the world. Living in a spirit of positivity, compassion, and love with a balance of independence and self determination. Nothing could be more inspiring and more rewarding than being the change I want to see in the world, within and without.

{{% accordion title="Authoring Background" id="authoring" %}}
In 2019 I suffered a Cerebral Hemorrhage. I wrote a [book](/publications/publication-most-improved/) about the experience of overcoming depression and how choosing mental/emotional strife over peace plays a direct role in shaping life.
