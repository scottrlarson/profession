## Preface

I have been a technology enthusiast since I was 10 years old, today I repair computers and provide solutions to everyday computer challenges for home users and very small businesses. 

The birth of this article started with a desire to leave an account of the computer scene before technological boom of 2000. I realized that nobody in my family really knows what it was like to grow up as a Computer Enthusiast, especially around the Amiga platform. The Amiga computer was a revolution in computing that I don't think many understand. As I writing about my experiences with this technology, I realized my take on the scene back then might interest a wider audience. 2022 is a precarious time for technology. One the one hand, computer technology is advancing at a breakneck speed, creating a quality of life that is beyond imagination. It's becoming so integrated into our lives that I wonder if we notice the indirect effects its having on our species. And on the other hand, the side effects of these advancements is that technology is driving our cultures in directions we don't really understand. That's why I think its important to be aware of the direction our world is taking by our choices.

As I was growing up, I often felt like I was living on the peripheral of life and didn't quite fit in with the accepted views of the time. Somehow this mindset, caused me to look at the inner workings or functions of the world. When I was 7 years old, my mother put me on a merry-go-round ride, instead of remaining on the mounted horse, I leaned over the edge of the ride, to look at the workings that caused the ride to spin.  This way of looking at the world often got me into trouble with authority figures as I would always try to understand a person's reasons for why they acted as they did. 

Today, technology is being heavily locked down by commercialization. During the introduction of the Home Computer, as kids of middle class families we explored its potential and possibilities. I think we were doing this as a way to improve the human experience. As we increased our dependence on technology for living, corporate factions started to form around its evolution. Today we have Microsoft, Apple and Google dictating how technology is being used in the world.   

What happened? Where are we heading as a human species? Are we driving the bus, or is the bus driving us? These are questions I hope we start thinking about before we move into the next iteration.

This article is for people interested in the evolution and the social impact of computer technology. My interests lie in the non-academic parts of life and my primary mode of learning is self-education. I'm a firm believer in independent thought. State level and many private educational systems have a way of contributing to a herd mentality. We need more people that can think outside the box. Schooling has its place for vocational learning, and we all need to make a living, but I have found that the real problems of life need people that can think independently of society.

For my part, I became interested in computing to tell stories about the future of humanity. My main interests were in the graphical capabilities of home computers but I also have an interest in sound, programming and visual art. Looking back, I realized I didn't want to be pinned down by just one discipline, so I chose to explore many different aspects of computer technology. Field specialization has strengths, but it also has weaknesses.

> “If we all reacted the same way, we'd be predictable, and there's always more than one way to view a situation...It's simple: overspecialize, and you breed in weakness. It's slow death.” - Motoko Kusanagi (Ghost in the Shell)

This article is part biographical, part techie, and part philosophical. My hope is to bring all these parts together in a way that can be understood. I'm glad a movement has started recently to preserve computer history. I hope my account can contribute to that endeavor, but my primary interest is in shining a light on how technology is being used in society to create systems of control, systems that we give our power to, that attempt to take away our individual value. 

With knowledge comes responsibility. You have been warned.
