<h2>Hardware Maintenance</h2>
<p>Desktops and laptops can suffer from shutdowns, boot failures, Blue Screen errors, and system crashes related to blocked ventilation or misconfigured hardware. Protect your computer from damage.<a title="hardware dust, debris cleaning configuration tuning" href="services/hardware-care"><br></a><!--break--></p>
<p><strong>If you ever have heard of term planned obsolescence? Did you know that Computer Manufacturers create Design flaws that decrease the life of your device so you have to purchase a new one a year or two later? Here's how:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ventilation ports that allow the heat to dissipate from the hardware get clogged with dust, dirt, hair, and other particles. This causes the device to over-heat and shutdown, decreasing the life of the computer.</li>
<li>Heat-sinks that distribute the flow of heat from hardware components have mounts that are made out of plastic and break over time causing the heat-sink to fall off and cause damage to the hardware.</li>
<li>Thermal paste that distributes the heat between the Processor and the heat sink is low quality becomes brittle over a short time. This process doesn't allow the hardware to remain at its optimum cooling temperature causing overheating and damage to the device.</li>
<li>Setting the processor's clock at speeds the cooling systems cant handle causes overheating, and over time this excessive&nbsp;overheating causes the hardware to fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If your computer is getting to hot to the touch or you find its shutting down after a short period of use, your computer could need some proper hardware care or a design flaw analysis and resolution.</strong></p>
<p>Excessive overheating for long periods of time can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shorten the life of your computer's or laptop's circuitry, causing instability that results in expensive hardware replacements.</li>
<li>Your laptop battery's life can be shortened significantly or your battery can even exploded due to heat caused by over charging.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Here is what I can do to solve many of these problems:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Diagnose the device to identify these problems.</li>
<li>Perform a comprehensive cleaning of the ventilation ports s involved in cooling the unit.</li>
<li>Apply high quality thermal solutions that keep the hardware free of overheating over a much longer period of time.</li>
<li>Return the Processor settings to a normal state of operation to prevent heat damage.</li>
</ul>
