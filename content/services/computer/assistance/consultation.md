I offer one on one consultations to advise or offer solutions to technical challenges either in my office or at your location. I sit down with you, record information about your problem and can offer a analysis/resolution or a cost estimate if the situation calls for further work or equipment. This information can be handed to you in print format or emailed to you electronically.
