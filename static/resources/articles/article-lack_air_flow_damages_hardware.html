<h2>How Lack of Air Flow Damages Hardware</h2>

<p>We had a customer who dropped off a dell desktop after the hard drive failed. The customer owned the computer for only two years before the breakdown and wondered why he was having problems so soon with the hardware. Noticing that his computer was full of dust in and around the ventilation ports resulting in poor air flow, we pointed this out to the customer. Shocked he decided to have regular maintenance done on his computer in the future.</p>
<p>Regular maintenance insures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your device has proper air flow by removing dust</li>
<li>Your CPU/Processor is operating a normal temapture by doing a thermal paste clean up.</li>
<li>Your device doesnt have any lose compoents or debris&nbsp;inside the case moving around that could cause hardware failures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Contact me by phone or visit my <a href="schedule-appointment">request form</a> to schedule regular maintenance on your computer so you dont decrease the life of your computer or lose important data.</p>
