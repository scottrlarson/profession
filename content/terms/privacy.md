## Communication Privacy Statement
During the servicing of your device, I may have to access certain areas of your file system, or online accounts, that might contain private information. I will not knowingly take any action that involves breaching the privacy to your digital information in any way. I take every effort within my ability to secure any private/personal communications/data from any locations that I service devices at. There is a possibility that my communications could be intercepted (that might contain information about you, or a 3rd party) without my knowledge. Also if my physical location is breached, your private information could be compromised. In these cases I am not liable for any damages that may result from any 3rd party intrusions.

## Data Privacy Statement
When you bring your device to me for servicing, I make an encrypted safety backup of your device's system data. This includes the system hard drive, or storage device, and/or any other device that is required for the system to function normally.

I do this in case a problem crops up after the service is complete that would prevent you from accessing your device. I keep this backup in encrypted form for around 4 months. This means that if my equipment were ever to get lost, or a theft occurred, it would not be easy to retrieve any personal information from my backups that are encrypted. I currently use standard 256-bit AES encryption for my backups.

I have strict principals against sharing private information about customers.
