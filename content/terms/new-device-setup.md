{{% alert title="Storage Encryption" %}}
In many cases, storage device encryption prevents me from providing the services you request. I require an unencrypted storage device before I can provide any services. If your storage device has been encrypted by the default Windows installation, I will decrypt it using the credentials you supplied to me to provide the service. If you require your storage device to be encrypted, you will have to re-enable that encryption after the service is complete. Having a device with unencrypted storage may open your data up to theft, protecting your data is your responsibility. If you have questions about this topic or need help please contact me before requesting service.

This might include removing, replacing or disabling (also by your request): security software, preloaded apps that are not part of the required core functionality of the system, or hardware that is causing performance bottlenecks. For example, I might increase the memory size, or the speed of the storage device.

At all times the device will be remain functional, but you might have an expectation about the device that I deliberately changed. If you have a required need for a default application, or setting/customization, that would have existed with another device provider, please let me know so that we can talk about that requirement.

If you request a removal of an application, you will be liable for any ramification of that request. For instance: If you request that a default security package be removed due to the fact that you prefer to install your own and you forget to perform that operation, and that inaction causes some kind of harm to you, another party, or to any property; You, and you alone are responsible.

## My Windows 10 Setup Service Includes Decluttering

Due to Windows 10 data collection practices and the impact it has on customer privacy, when I install, reinstall, or tune-up Windows 10 on any machine that enters this office, I remove and disable the unnecessary and in many cases unwanted functions listed below. You can opt to install or re-enable the app in question yourself by launching the Microsoft Store App on your computer, doing a search for the missing App, and then installing it. (Please note that I do not guarantee any performance improvements on any of these adjustments.):

- I disable all Telemetry and Data Collection services.
- I uninstall all Microsoft Windows 10 apps, except the basic, or useful ones that would prevent the normal operation of the device: Mail, Microsoft Store, Calculator, Sticky, Windows.photos, Soundrecorder, MSpaint, Screensketch, Cortana.
- I may Install new default applications to make use of: Photos(Fast Stone Image Viewer), Internet Browsing(Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome), Email(Mozilla Thunderbird) Videos(VLC), and Media Creation(Burn Aware).

I do this to give my customers a good experience with their device by decluttering the operation of Windows 10. This has the potential to improve the performance and user experience.
