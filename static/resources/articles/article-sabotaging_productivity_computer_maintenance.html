<h2>Sabotaging Your Productivity by Neglecting Regular Computer Maintenance</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A long-standing customer Andrew G., with a high-end PC I built for him back in 2009 has a backup disk that is failing and in mid-2015 called me to swap the drive out for a higher capacity replacement. The physical replacement was straightforward but due to a set of outdated drivers, Windows fails to see it's full size capability. Updating the driver not only resolves the problem it also improves the performance of the system’s boot up time by 75%. Due to the fact that diagnosing and fixing the driver problem doubled the cost of what would otherwise have been a simple job, and the build up of dust in the desktop that could have been causing heat problems Andrew is now on a recurring maintenance schedule to prevent problems like this before they come up. <em>Customers full name and contact details available upon request</em></li>

  <li>A customer that wishes to remain anonymous purchased a dell desktop in late 2012. A couple of months ago, the drive fails completely and Bert asks me to replace it. During the hard drive replacement process I again find heavy dust build up around the ventilation ports of the case. I replace the drive, clean the case, and recommend having regular maintenance on the desktop in the future.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Did you know devices with poor ventilation can reach temperatures between °90 and °120 Fahrenheit?</h3>
<p><em>A <a href="http://research.google.com/archive/disk_failures.pdf">Google study</a> on hard drive failures shows that aging hard disk drives (3 years and older) were much more prone to failure when their average temperatures were °110 or higher.</em></p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Judy D. brought in her HP Laptop with a drive that crashed. She wanted me to replace it and rebuild the operating system. After further discussion on if she had a backup that we could restore from, we found that her network backup solution was not operating correctly due to a issue with outdated hardware. After the replacement and repair we resolved the backup issue and the laptop is now being backed up on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Andrew was lucky because his failing drive was his backup drive and he did not lose the use of his computer. Anonymous and Judy, however, both lost data and were without their computers for sever days. Now, i'm sure many of you might be rolling your eyes, or maybe the thought crossed your mind that this kind of situation hardly every happens. Out of a snapshot of 40 customers who had their devices serviced for data loss, and/or repair, 14% of those devices had hard drives that were dead on arrival; data unrecoverable. I also regularly question customers about their current backup strategy and most don't know if their devices are being backed up, or if they are haven't had a chance to assess the continued operation of the backup.</p>

<p>All of these situations can be prevented. Just spend a few minutes asking yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do I have data that I don't want to lose?</li>
  <li>If my device stopped working, how long could I be without it while its being repaired or rebuilt?</li>
  <li>If my device is being backed up, when was the last time I checked to see if the backup was working? Do I know how to backup? If not, should I call Scott to have a look?</li>
</ul>
<p>Having recurring maintenance service in place prevents these kinds of issues from turning into disasters. Regular computer maintenance is more than just an insurance policy, it keeps you informed and in the loop with where you are at any given moment to the status of your technology needs.</p>

<h3 id="reoccuring-maintenance-benefits">Reoccuring Maintenance Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Flag and fix current hardware and software problems.</li>
  <li>My real world hardware and software assessment helps predict future problems before they become disasters.</li>
  <li>Utilizing my customer incident tracking system, I can create a timeline of your device history which actually decreases the time I spend in each service on each service call, and helps me spot potential issues that might become real problems in the future.</li>
</ul>
