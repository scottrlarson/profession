I get a lot of laptops in for repairs that are not worth the plastic they are printed on. In my view, the computer industry isn't great about getting the proper information out. They want buyers to purchase the most advertised models. Ones that have a low cost to manufacture so the highest profits can be had. Price is really only looked at and what the end up getting is a laptop that cuts so many corners in design and performance, its not even worth fixing.

My goal here is to educate you on what to look for when shopping for a new device. The kind of laptop you need will depend on your specific requirements.

If at all possible, do your shopping for electronics on-line.  Better information about purchases can be found at sites like: [Amazon](amazon.com) or [Newegg](newegg.com). These sites do a better job at listing the technical specifications if each product. In many cases, referencing the specs for a prodcut you are thinking of purchasing will help you make a proper decision.

There are 8 basic food groups for laptops:

1. The Dimensions (Physical): Is it going to be mobile, or a homebody?
2. The Weight: Are you going to be lugging around a monstrosity, or a light weight?
3. The Construction: Does it look and feel like cheap plastic? Or does it feel like a sleek air plane? This may matter to you, or not.
4. The Speed: Are you going to be riding a turtle, or a high-speed train?
5. The Capacity: Do you plan on storing those pictures and music somewhere?
6. The Visuals: Are you going to need some eye wear for that screen?
7. The Life: How long can I survive without the power cord?
8. The Response: What have been people saying about the device.

## The Dimensions (Physical): Is it going to be mobile, or a homebody?

Size matters. But not in the way you might think. If you are someone that is, at many times, on the go having a big lug of a laptop to carry around with you isn't always the best idea. On the other hand, if the thing is not going to move much, at has a solid home of a desk or table, having a big unit might help. The reason to have a big unit is that, usually, the follow areas are improved: 1. There is plenty of room for airflow, which increase the life of the unit. 2. A large screen, which can be better on your eyes. 3. In many cases, size equates to better construction, and with better construction there is a tenancy for the unit to last longer.

You might ask why get a laptop in the first place if its not really going to be moved around? Well with a laptop, the first reason is that all the [component's]() are within the unit itself, and that makes it easier to move around. With a desktop, you have to unhook many peripherals: The keyboard, mouse, display, and any other external devices just to move it.

In my view, there are more weaknesses, than strengths by purchasing a laptop over a desktop, but that's another topic, for another day. If you are interested in more information about this [contact](/#contact) me.

## The Weight: Are you going to be lugging around a monstrosity, or a light weight?

Weight matters. Three pounds versus five? It doesn't seem like a huge difference right? After carrying a 5 pound device around with you on a regular basis, that extra weight adds up. 

## The Construction: Does it look and feel like cheap plastic? Or does it feel like a sleek air plane? This may matter to you, or not.

Construction characteristics of a laptop can matter depending on what kind of use its going to get, and how long you want it to last. Cheap plastic can easily crack over time with normal use. This is especially important if the laptop is being moved around on a regular basis. It needs a solid construction and good materials to live up to the abuse. Also the kind of materials matter. Plastic versus carbon fiber versus aluminum. The design of the construction matters as well. Since Laptops are contructed with all the compoents packed togeather, he is always an issue, and dissapating the heat becomes more important. In my experience business class laptops are designed better than consumer grade ones. Many manufacters have diffent classes of laptos based on what segment its being sold in. You can purchase a laptop in any segment you choose. Business class laptops, although built better, are more expensive.


## The Speed: Are you going to be riding a turtle, or a high-speed train?

The speed of a laptop for the lay person can be very difficult to discover from the basic info that in my cases gets listed in a store display. There are a few factors that need to be put into account. 

Think of a computer as a nervous system in a body. It's a collection of neurons(Wires) that transmit signals between different parts of the body. Computers are very similar, in that, they have parts that all need to communicate with each other. Each part is dependent on the other for speedy communication, and when one of them lags behind, all the other parts in the chain suffer. This is why you can have a laptop with a fast processor, but if the laptop has a limited amount of <a href="#Terms">RAM</a> The system speed will be determined by the storage capacity of that part.


When thinking in terms of speed. Don't just think of the speed of the <a href="#Terms">Processor (CPU)</a> also think about the class and generation of the processor itself. Also look at the storage capacity of the RAM and the speed of the storage device. RAM is the amount of memory that the laptop has. For Windows 10 4 gigs of ram is low and 8 gigs is better. Also having a Soild State Storage device improves performance over a Hard Disk Storage device.

## The Capacity: Do you plan on storing those pictures and music somewhere?

Storage size might be important to you. Getting an SSD is great, but if its not big enough to store your data, that might be a problem. The larger that the SSD is, the more expensive it's going to be. Some Laptops have SSD/HDD combinations to keep the cost down. THE SSD is the boot device, and the HDD is the storage device. But it makes it a bit more complicated to store information because then you have to remember to store your data on the HDD. You can also set your user folders to store information on the HDD. Generally configuration is still fast, because most of the heavy lifting is done by the SSD and the HDD is really just a storage option for your data, and loading it off of a HDD isnt not really a problem as long as it is all that is dooing.

## The Visuals: Are you going to need some eye wear for that screen?


The size of the laptop (screen and the quality of the resolution is also important. Theere are 17', 15', 13' and 11' laptops. The small the screen the harder it's going to be to read text, and the less screen real-estate you will have to work with applications. But if you are just sending emails and writing docs on-the-go it might not be important. But for a photo profession, that might be another story.


## The Life: How long can I survive without the power cord?


battery life might be important to you if you are allways on the go. Typically, the slimmer the laptop, the better battery life it will have since its not powering compoents that require alot of power such as a HDD or optical drive. But check the specifications of the device. If it has a really fast processor like a i7, battery life will suffer. There will usually be a line that says, "Up to X hours battery life on a single charge" It's been my experience that if you take that number and cut in half that will be your real-world battery operating time.

## The Response: What have been people saying about the device.

Look at reviews of the model you want to purchase on amazon or newegg. Newer models tend to have less reviews that ones that have been on the marking for awhile. Look at the type of reviews how many are in support of the model, and how many are agianst it. Also look at the quality of the review. If a review has a short one-line statement that tells you nothing about the experience, its usually not a good mesure of quality.



- Add processor generations
- Add manufacters do not allways display procesor gen, in this case you will have to look it up doing a google search with the processor make and model
