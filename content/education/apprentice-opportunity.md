I am interested in training an apprentice in my field. If you, or someone you know, are/is interested in an in-depth understanding of how hardware and software computer technology works to be able to troubleshoot your own computer problems, or build your own computer, this apprenticeship opportunity is for you. 

This is a very special arrangement for a student, or an adult that is willing to learn new ideas in how to provide a successful Computer Repair or Information Technology service. This is a voluntary time giving initiative on my part which (if interested) could lead to a paid working relationship. 

I have over 25 years experience with computer technology, but I also have many other interests that impacts how I operate my service to the community. I have worked with many computing platforms. I started with the Commodore brand in the eighties and then moved on to the PC platform in the nineties. In between that I was also working with Apple hardware and the Unix environment.

My main interests are in gaming technology. I'm a old school gamer at heart and am currently working toward learning how to develop my own games. I prefer open source software, but in many cases I also work with closed source software when an open source alternative isn't available.

Eventual I would like to apprentice two individuals. One who is interested in repairing/upgrading laptops and another repairing upgrading desktops.

- Willingness to be open to new ideas and concepts outside of your current belief system that leads to professionalism in the field of computer technology.

## Skills You Will Learn
