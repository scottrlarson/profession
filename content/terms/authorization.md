When you bring in your device, you will be handed an authorization form that details the work involved along with the below authorization:

>I hereby, or have been given power, on behalf of the individual who owns the above device that will be serviced, to authorize Scott Larson to make requested "diagnostics", "repairs", "upgrades", or "replacements". If I plan on having this device serviced under warranty, it's my sole responsibility to determine if Scott Larson's servicing violates that warranty. This makes me liable for an costs that may occur because of this violation if I attempt to have the device serviced under warranty after the servicing.  I understand and agree to pay, any and all, service fees specified in the Payment Authorization, or communicated during the process of the servicing, regardless of the outcome. <b>All payments are due via check or cash, immediately before return of the device.</b> In the event that I request any service that requires Scott Larson to "recover", "reset", or "destroy" any data,  device,  or login credentials on owners equipment, I release Scott Larson of all liability and responsibility for any loss or damage.  I understand that Scott Larson is not, under any circumstances, responsible for any loss of data. In the event of, but not limited to, a hardware, or software related failure that results, due to design flaws in the hardware/software, physical wear and tear to the device, software glitches, bugs, mishandling of hardware, or software, by myself, or any third party, I agree to take full responsibility and I become liable for all damages and all costs that may result due to any circumstance above while my device device is being serviced. In the event of Insurance Loss and/or Peril to me or my property, that is not covered under this agreement, or if the device was not working properly at the time of the authorization, I shall limit the amount of damage to two thousand dollars maximum total loss on myself, and all equipment. I understand that Scott Larson may need certain information (like login details or software packages) to provide services. Price quotes and estimates are determined by the available information Scott Larson has at hand at the time of intake. I understand that prices quoted or estimated are subject to change if new information is required or becomes available during the servicing. I will be notified ahead of time before prices change. If I refuse to continue servicing after a price change, I agree to pay any and all outstanding quoted or estimated charges, regardless of the state of the device, or the status/progress of the work. I understand during hardware repairs, Scott Larson replaces, instead of repairing hardware damage to improve the life of the device. <b>Any equipment left behind for over a period of 90 days with out communication by the owner will be destroyed/recycled. I agree that any hardware owner leaves behind may be sold to cover any outstanding payments to Scott Larson not received within 60 days of the date of invoicing. I understand that all personal data will be irrevocably destroyed to protect my privacy. If I leave behind a device for servicing, I understand Scott Larson will make every effort to contact me, but if I am not reachable via Phone, Email or Post within this time frame, regardless of the reason, I am giving up ownership of my equipment.</b>
