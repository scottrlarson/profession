This article is a companion piece on the evolution of the Home Computer and the cultural impact technology has on society today. It's a glimpse at where computing culture was, and were its heading. 

This article is part of a 5 part series: 

- [Introduction](/memorials/memorial-my-home-computer-reflections-part-1/)
- [My First Computer](/memorials/memorial-my-home-computer-reflections-part-2/)
- [The C64 & A500](/memorials/memorial-my-home-computer-reflections-part-3/)
- [Amiga Games, The BBS Days & 3d Modeling](/memorials/memorial-my-home-computer-reflections-part-4/)
- [That was then, this is now](/memorials/memorial-my-home-computer-reflections-part-5/)

This is my personal take on the evolution of the Home Computer. A Home Computer is one of the first computers designed for the home that inspired the [technology revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_revolution) we see today.

I tinkered with computer hardware and software as a kid. As a young adult and learned how to service computers from people in the repair business. Now I run my own computer repair service and for over 20 years I have been providing technical assistance to home users and very small businesses.

This piece is for people interested in the evolution and the social impact of computer technology. Even though I have some academic schooling in my past, my interests lie in the non-academic parts of life and my primary mode of learning is self-education. 

The home computer scene of my time was a creative revolution centered around the hacking scene. It was a time of endless potential and I saw many creative technologies push the limits of what was possible. This might be true today, but for me, innovation of this time is losing much of its appeal. Endeavors have this "Making Money" quality to it that removes all the spirit of what was like to generate for the common good. 

The golden age of the Home Computer revolution ended abruptly in the early nineties when technology started to be heavily commercialized. Many might not have noticed, but in early 2000, as computing became a mainstream part of life, and with the introduction of the internet, certain social aspects associated with the golden age of home computers started to die off. An era that was filled with creativity, community and independence suddenly lost its appeal. What happened?  

For my part, I became interested in computing to tell stories about the future of humanity. My main interests were in the graphical capabilities of home computers but I also have an interest in sound, programming and visual art. Looking back, I realized I didn't want to be pinned down by just one discipline, so I chose to explore many different aspects of computer technology. Field specialization has strengths, but it also has weaknesses.

It seems like our educational systems are focus solely on the theoretical applications of technology. In my view, more practical learning is needed in the world. The theoretical, controlled environment approach to learning is killing us as a species.

The birth of this article started out with the intention of leaving something behind about life for my family. I realized while writing this that maybe I have something to say to a larger audience. As I was growing up, I often felt like I was living on the peripheral of life and didn't quite fit in with the accepted views of the time. Somehow this mindset, caused me to look at the inner workings or functions of the world. When I was 7 years old, my mother put me on a merry-go-round ride, instead of remaining on the mounted horse, I leaned over the edge of the ride, to look at the workings that caused the ride to spin.  This way of looking at the world often got me into trouble with authority figures as I would always try to understand a person's reasons for why they acted as they did. 

But as a grew into adulthood I mostly felt empowered by my temperament. I spend much of my life making independent studies of interesting subjects. My parents were always supportive of this way of learning and I thank them for not trying to pressure me to be something I was not.  They did their best to encourage my freedom of expression, within their means of course, sometimes we don't have the capability to accept people as they are, and attempt to mold them into our way of experiencing the world. This is mainly due to how we can become uncomfortable with situations that shake our world view. Exploring my own interests, free from (at least to a larger extent) societal conditioning created this gap in my life that has allowed me to see the world in a slightly nuanced way.

This article is part biographical, part techie, and part philosophical. My hope is to bring all these parts together in a way that can be understood. I'm glad a movement has started recently to preserve computer history. I hope my account or the way I think, can contribute to that endeavor, but my primary interest is in shining a light on how technology is being used in society to create systems of control, systems that we give our power to, that attempt to take away our individual value. 

With knowledge comes responsibility. You have been warned.
