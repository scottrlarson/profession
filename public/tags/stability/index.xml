      <description>New desktops and laptops often are delivered with out-of-date windows components and hardware specific drivers and firmware. By upgrading and updating these components, something that is not easily done by just letting the Windows Update Service do all the heavy lifting, downtime and frustration is minimized working with a computer system that is not fully ready for operation out of the box. Also new devices are shipped with all of the Windows features enabled and in many cases, can get in the way of a smooth functioning system.</description>
