A book published in a format designed for print works great for the print world, but in today's world your book needs to be more accessible to the electronic world. 

I take your completed work from the processed format and perform layout and style conversion to the flow of the text and illustrations. Or if need be I can create custom a design that matches the platform that the book will be read on.

I can work with many print format's and convert them to the digital world where reading is done on a digital screen. It's important that you book's content can be reflowed for devices that have different size and shapes, from mobile devices all the way to desktop computers. The look and feel of your E-book should look like it was designed for the screen it is being read on. 

Check out some [examples](/projects/ebooks) of my ebook conversion work.
