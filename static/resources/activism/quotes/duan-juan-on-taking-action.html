<p>&ldquo;Whenever a warrior decides to do something, he must go all the way, but he must take responsibility for what he does. No matter what he does, he must know first why he is doing it, and then he must proceed with his actions without having doubts or remorse about them.&rdquo; - Don Juan (Journey to Ixtlan, Carlos Castaneda)</p>
