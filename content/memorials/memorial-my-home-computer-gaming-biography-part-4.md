## Amiga games that influenced my life
**The days of Future Wars, Another World & Flashback**

With the release of the Amiga platform, games started springing up with amazing capabilities in visuals and sound. Beyond anything I experienced before, igniting my imagination with possibilities. Eventually my gaming experience on the Amiga platform inspired me to invest my time and energy into 3D modeling and graphic design which later engaged my interest in film and finally writing for film.

**Future Wars**, a science fiction adventure game release on Amiga Platform. Future Wars might not have been an amazing success like other games at the time, but I love expoloring the concept of time and doing so in a game that sported such amazing graphics and sound, made possible by the Amiga platform, helped me to continue to explore my interests in science. This was in my early twenties as I developed an interest in temporal mechanics after reading a book on the subject.

## The fall of Commodore as a company and jumping ship
I remember the end of the eighties commodore was struggling to keep up with the technological advancements. research shows that they didn't understand the potential of the Amiga platform and the people behind it. On the ground I just remember that the platform was being limited by somehting as software was not being written for it as many developers started migrated to the PC or Mac platform. I eventually had to jump ship and switche over to a PC platform. I often look back at this time because the Amiga platform was doing things at the time that was ahead of its time, and I often wonder where we would be at now if commedore survived. I think we would be at least 5 or 10 years more advanced than we are now. Because of PC compatibility the technolgoy moves at a slower rate. Apple is less limited by this problem,
