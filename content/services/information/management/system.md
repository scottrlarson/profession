I provide home and small office system management services for security, backup and maintenance of your computer, or computers. System Management services include monitoring and maintenance of your devices with robust security software, upkeep of your device, and regular disaster recovery backups of your most important data.

Just like a car, over time, and use, computers require regular maintenance and a fresh look at these important areas of your digital life by someone with experience in forecasting future hardware and software problems. Keeping your computer maintained (Updating Software, and monitoring security and backups) helps prevents catastrophic events from occurring.

## Backup System Management Service Information

{{% accordion-list title="Backup System Management Case Study" id="disaster-rec-info"  %}}
### Why would I want Disaster Recovery Backup System Management?
- One of my customers was surprised that the service Carbonite was not backing up a special accounting program data. Due to the way in which the application accessed the proprietary data the application prevented Carbonite from accessing and backing-up the data. The customer had to rebuild that particular data set from scratch.
- When you run a business and have special software you rely on, I can sit down with you, and find out what data is most important to secure. I provide solutions that aim to prevent catastrophic loss of critical data. In monitoring backup, I can determine what is being backed up. With my **Upkeep System Management Service** I monitoring the life of the hardware which allows me to alert you of a pending failure, or trigger a backup before a loss occurs. Even if you have simple needs, don't let the upgrade of your current system slip though the cracks of a upgrade.

### Definitions

- **S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) **is a monitoring system included in computer hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and eMMC drives. Its primary function is to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability with the intent of anticipating imminent hardware failures. When remotely monitoring S.M.A.R.T. It's possible to detect imminent storage drive failures, so preventative action can be taken to prevent data loss, the failing drive can be replaced and data integrity maintained. 

- **Backup redundancy** protects your data from data loss. In the instance of a local backup if you system is lost or taken a cloud backup would protect you against theft or loss.


- As of 2020 I use **Macrium Reflect as a Backup** and Disaster recovery solution. It is a reliable and well a tested product for making regular backups and restores of both system and personal data. Macrium Software was founded in 2006 when CEO and Founder Nick Sills experienced a personal data disaster and in the process discovered existing backup tools were not as good as he expected. Wanting a software solution that was practical and easy to use, Nick and his team developed Macrium Reflect to create a safe and secure disk image with ultra-fast recovery times should disaster strike.

- This Management service **does not cover costs of installation or replacement hardware**, if any.
