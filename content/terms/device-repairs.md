When you bring your device in for servicing, after a repair, or when you agree to allow me to remotely manage your device's security, backup or upkeep, I may install certain applications/shortcuts on your desktop that help provide ongoing services or to maintain a business relationship. 

Below are a list of software I use and may install on your device/s and you can uninstall these applications at any time if you feel you do not need them. If you have an ongoing service with me, you might want to make contact with me first:

- **[Kabuto](https://www.repairtechsolutions.com/kabuto/)**: An application/desktop shortcut that displays my business contact information and a contact form where you can request future services. If you so choose, I can also [manage](/services/information/management/system/) your device's security and upkeep from this application for a fee listed on the [information services](/services/information/management/) section of my website.
- **[Hard Disk Sentinel](https://www.hdsentinel.com/)**: Related to my System Management Service. HDS monitors your storage device's health and provides me with alerts in the event of a storage device failure. This allows me to make you aware of a critical situation that could cause a loss of data.
- **[Emsisoft](https://www.emsisoft.com)**: A security package that helps protect your device from threats.
- **[Zoho Assist](https://www.zoho.com/assist/)**: Remote control software that helps me connect to your computer remotely to help you with a problem or maintain your device. There are two types of Zoho Assist: 
  1. **[Zoho Assist](https://www.zoho.com/assist/)** which only works when you request help and
  2. **[Zoho Assist Unattended Agent](https://www.zoho.com/assist/)**, which allows me to connect to your device without a request. I usually install the unattended agent only on a device that is under a system management agreement. I only make remote connections to your device with your knowledge and consent usually under a pre-arranged appointment, unless an agreement is in place to perform a service in another fashion.
