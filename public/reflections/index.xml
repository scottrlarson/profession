      <description>I am involved in doing interpersonal work with the Mankind Project. I joined MKP after my brain injury in 2017 and ever since I have been writing about life. This piece is about my introduction into this work.
I&amp;rsquo;m Scott Larson, Purple Flower Turtle. I initiated at Camp Royaneh Cazadero, CA in 2018. My initiation into the Mankind Project brotherhood changed my life forever. Before I committed to the New Warrior Training Adventure, I joined an I Group in my area called &amp;ldquo;Brothers of Other Mothers&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I am involved in doing interpersonal work with the Mankind Project and one of the topics that came up for me this week is my behavior around anger and irritation towards others when I want to push people away. I am discovering that aspects of my behavior around my mother (The Feminine) is a result of what I have learned from my Father (The Masculine). The way in which my parents related to each other contains a male dominating aspect to it.</description>

      <description>Dear kinsman, I am writing this letter to you in the message of the spirit in the hopes that you will receive it one day. You have been missing for a generation. We have heard from the Great Soul that you have become lost in the &amp;ldquo;Forgotten Land&amp;rdquo; where many of our brethren have gone missing. We wonder why you have taken a detour from your pilgrimage to the final resting place.</description>

      <description>The sun is a friend to me. It lights up the way to myself, filling me with gratitude and wellbeing. Even when it shines in my face while I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write. I cannot become too annoyed. I know that to become annoyed is to invite a breakdown. Being a man requires calmness and patience. For myself, my world, and my life.
Every day I get up when the sun rises, and go to sleep when the sun sets.</description>

      <description>I come alive when I get out of my own way. After I had a Cerebral Hemorrhage back in 2017, my physiology changed. I will call this health challenge &amp;ldquo;The Event&amp;rdquo; moving forward. A turning point in my life that was on the level of how an earthquake shakes up the landscape. I spontaneously developed different habits and goals for my life. And it changed the kind of person I was destined to be.</description>
