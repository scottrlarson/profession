Maintaining batter life can somewhat be a moving target. Lithium Ion batteries are used in most electronics since 2013. Unfortunately, little has changed with its technology.

Storing these batteries does not preserve their life expectancy. Slowly over time the batter loses its life expectancy. Below is a chart on the average loss based on the temperature that the battery is stored in:

You can improve the life expectancy of the battery by storing it in a cold environment. The problem with storing batteries like these in the fridge is that condensation can cause damage to the battery over time.

If you plan on storing your device battery in the fridge, let it discharge to about 40%, put it in a freezer bag, or better yet store it in a sealed container with [desiccant's](https://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=desiccant%20pack&linkCode=ur2&tag=groovyads-20&url=search-alias%3Daps) that take oxygen out of the storage unit.

When you are ready to use the battery when you take it out of the fridge please make sure it sits in room temperature for a length of time that removes all condensation from the outside of the battery.
