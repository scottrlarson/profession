I moved my office on 3/1/2019 to a new and improve location. 555 5th Street Suite 230-a. I'm still downtown a block away from the Santa Rosa Plaza.

This new location has a bigger space to operate. As of 1/1/2019 my rates have changed as well. Check my [rates](/#rates) page for more information. With this new location I offer faster and a quicker turn-around time.

I am one of two people that operates so close to downtown Santa Rosa. I am one of the most experienced in techs this field for this area. I am very responsive, I keep excellent records, and provide secure and safe location to drop off your device.
