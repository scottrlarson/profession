Did you know that solid state storage devices (SSD) (What your computer, or laptop stores and reads information on/from) have a life expectancy time line? The life span of the device has an endurance level. This means that a few factors will determine how well the storage device will endure use. My experience is that storage devices usually last between 3 and 5 years, but you can get away with more if you are an infrequent user of the device. If you have important data, or a setup that you do not want to rebuild, what's important is to have a plan for what you are going to do when your device fails. Some of my customers opt to have a second device on hand so the can coninue working if there primary device goes down, but this requires file synchronization of some kind. Dropbox, or Allway Sync are to solutions that help with this dilemma.

### Symptoms that may decrease the life of your storage device

- The age of the device (when it was manufactured. Pre 2015 technology does not have same durability characteristics as newer technology.)
- How much, and how often information is written to the device: Depending on how your device is used, saving your important work data on some other storage device other than the system device may improve it's life. A micro flash drive is a good example of this. Saving your important work on another portable device may improve the durability of the internal system storage device. It also has the benefit of portability, you can move it between more than one device. (Please be sure to back this device up. If it becomes lost or damaged you data is lost forever. I suggest [Carbonite's Safe Plus plan](https://www.carbonite.com/backup-software/carbonite-safe), or for local backups [EaseUS ToDo Backup Plus](https://www.easeus.com/backup-software/tb-home.html)
- How much free space that is maintained on the device (Maintaining 1/2 of the space free increases the life expectancy of the device.)

### Disaster Recovery Backups

My disaster recovery backup solution uses software, and a external storage device, like a USB hard drive, or a network attached storage device to regularly store a copy of your settings/configurations, programs, and personal data like documents and music on another media in the event of catastrophic failure of your storage device. SSD's are more prone to catastrophic failures then Hard Disk Drives are. When the fail, the often fail in such a way that it requires very expensive techniques to recover that data.
