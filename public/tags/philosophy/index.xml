      <description>A story of transformation from selfishness to selflessness.
 &amp;ldquo;Most Improved&amp;rdquo; is a meditation on the process of personal transformation. I experienced a transformation from a &amp;ldquo;self-centered&amp;rdquo; worldly view on life, to a &amp;ldquo;universe-connected&amp;rdquo; consciousness, where all life has meaning. In August of 2017, I suffered a Cerebral Hemorrhage. While at work, I collapsed, was taken to the hospital, and diagnosed with high blood pressure. My recovery was a miracle, I suffer only minor damage to my body&amp;rsquo;s sensory systems, that improved over time.</description>
