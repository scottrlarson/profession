During the servicing of your device I may have to access certain areas of your file system that might contain private information. I will not take any action that involves breaching the privacy to your digital information in any way.

I take every effort within my ability to secure the communications and my locations that I service devices at. This does not mean that someone with a strong motive could piggy back on my communications or my physical location to invade your privacy. If that ever happens you agree not to hold me responsible.
