When you request a service from me by yourself or as part of any organization it is by contract by your authorization or recurring engagement with me to have a service performed. Please note that any arrangement between us is two party. You [Customer] and I [Service Man]. My status is an individual who provides a service, not an employee. As such if I provide a service for you that results in an exchange of property [My services for currency] I do not have any contracts in place to exchange property with 3rd parties [government or otherwise]. If my services require you to report tax information to a 3rd party that reporting does not include me, my property, or the results of any property exchanged for services rendered. If you have questions about this arrangement please contact me.
