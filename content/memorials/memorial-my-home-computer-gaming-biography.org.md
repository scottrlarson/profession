My first experience with computers started in the 1980's on one of the first home computers, the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A. I was about 12 years old. I think Personal Computers were expensive at the time, over a thousand dollars in value. We would visit are only friend that had a computer and play the game we played game ""**Tunnels of Doom**"". As far as I know, it was the first multi-player turn-based [dungeon crawler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_crawl) released at that time. We would start our morning loading our previous save game from the weekend before off of a cassette tape, which would take several hours. After dinner our game would be loaded and we would each play our  respective turns. It was the first continuous game experience that would last more than one sitting where I learned to cooperate with other players to complete objectives.

A few years after my experience with the TI994a. My parents notice my enthusiasm in science and computers. I think they wanted to turn me into a scientist and saw the home computer as a step up from my childhood dream of getting myself into trouble. 

A quick side note, I had brief introduction into electronics theory and practicalities by my Uncle Jim, who worked as a electrician in WWII, and later became a city electrician. On occasion, when my parents went away on vacation, they would ship me to Chicago to visit my Uncle. He showed me the basics of the apprentice craft. A few years of my life was spent in his basement, building small electronic devices together. Maybe that's why I jump at the prospect of getting my hands on newly released gadgets today.  

As far as electronics go, the computer was, and is, a different beast. Obviously, the inner workings of a computer operates on the same principles of electric current. But what made home computers different from electronics is the software programming aspect of it. Programming is like creating a list of instructions for something to happen. When a computer receives a list of instructions, at the end of the day, is really all about flipping switches. Flipping a sequence of switches actually, in a way the computer can understand.

Anyways, this enthusiasm got me my first computer, a Commodore 64. I'm skipping the part where my real first computer was a TRS-80. Because, well, if you didn't know, back then, it was consider the [Trash 80](https://dfarq.homeip.net/trash-80-what-it-meant-and-why-it-stuck/) by my compadres, and I don't want to mar my reputation :P. It was as good of a computer as any during that time, but since it was sold by Radio Shack, I think it developed a bad reputation because Radio Shack's electronics were considered subpar.

Anyways, forget I ever said anything about that. On to the extraordinary achievement of the mid-eighties. I bring you, the Commodore 64!

### Commodore 64

The C64 was my first computer, if you were using computers at the time, it was likely your first computer too, as most business class computers liked the IBM were too expensive to afford. Naturally, I explored the capabilities of personal computers. I learned C64 basic, the coding language at the time and speech synthesizing (Converting text into speech). But really I was mostly playing games. 

I imagine most people at the time thought, and maybe currently think now, that computer games are peripheral to what is going on in the world. In fact, I think there was a real stigma to art and entertainment in my childhood years. Everyone in my neck of the woods seemed to want to appear like they were doing something of importance, that usually meant having a good job with some well known corporation, and making sure we appeared to be supporting capitalism. 

Some of that must have rubbed off on me, because to this day, I still feel empty if I am not doing something externally productive with my life. But after reflecting on my childhood experiences with computer gaming, I realized that games, and having fun are a basic fundamental of being human. Sound, graphics, and story elements, that reflected the challenges we are facing in modern society had a real impact on my artistic direction and it helped me explore the real problems with our culture's need to [dominate other cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony). There is a great documentary on the independent gaming culture and it's positive impact on the developers of games as they were growing up called "[Gameloading: Rise of the Indies](https://gameloading.vhx.tv/videos/gameloading-stereo)". 

During this time, I was combining what I knew about electronics from my Uncle by adding modifications to my C64 peripherals. A few crude applications I can remember implementing, were to save power of my peripherals and increase the operating speed of disk drives, which usually result in read/write problems. These kinds of modifications to hardware were probably directly related to why I choose a path of building gaming computers for myself and friends when the PC platform became more modular, which eventually inspired me to start my own computer repair business.

The 1980's was an interesting era for computers. There was fierce competition between business PC's, which were more static in their design (not as easily upgradable) and personal computers (Which were designed with upgradability in mind). It definitely seemed like an ideological movement between freedom and choice, how you want to use and change hardware that you owned, and business PC's that wanted you to purchase whatever they sold you, and didn't want customers changing or upgrading the hardware. I'm glad that personal computers eventually won that round. But another round of removing customer choice has returned recently with Computer software and hardware designers, like Microsoft, Apple, HP, Dell and others. Many current computer hardware manufacturers and software developers are designing static hardware and software around a [walled garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform) perspective. You can see this perspective with the push to cloud software as a service. You can read more about my thoughts around this in my "[Will one repairable laptop change the world?](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-future-of-repairability/)" article.
 


### Commodore Amiga 500

Commodore, instramental in launching the Home Computer movement foward focused on low cost alternatives to the high end, high price market that the juggernaughts Apple and IBM involved in at the time. Commodore's decisions around the development of the Home Computer launched many innovations forward that many computer enthusists at the time adopted with open arms. When the Amiga 500 released, it sported a new development called "Open Achictechure". A first for computer enthusists, simmilar to the cocenpt of modularity, parts could be removed, replaced and upgraded.


> ‘We need to build computers for the masses, not the classes.‘ was Commodore’s founder Jack Tramiel’s motto.

I remember spending way to much of my money on memory upgrades and expansion cards in compeitition with my friends to give me that extra edge, but also to be involved in an amazing hobby with others. We shared ideas and software and the Amiga expanding our concepts of possibilities at the time.

#### The days of Future Wars and Another World
**Commodore Amiga games that influenced my life**

With the release of the Amiga platform, games started springing up with amazing graphics and sound. Beyond anything I experienced before, the capibilities of these features ignighting my imagination with possibitlies. Eventually my gaming experience on the Amiga platform inspired me to invest my time and energy into 3D modeling and graphic design.

![Future Wars](/img/memorials/games/delphine-software/future-wars/futurewars-cover.jpg)
In my early twenties I develop an interest in Time travel after reading a book on Temporal Mechanics. So when the adventure game, **Future Wars** came out on the Amiga Platform I was as ecstatic as a hobbit in a pie shop. Future Wars might not have been an amazing success like other games at the time, but I love expoloring the concept of time and doing so in a game that sported such amazing graphics and sound, made possible by the Amiga platform, helped me to continue to explore my interests in science .

## This is Now

### Custom built Computers
I currently build my own computers (Assemble from hardware on the market), but I also repair OEM computers as well.

#### x64 Operating Systems
**Linux**
**Windows**

#### Current software I utilize
I'm a avid supporter of open source software, especially with Microsoft and Apple software. These companies create whats called "[Walled Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform)", anti-competitive approaches to their respective operating systems. For the average customer of computer products, it might not be a visible issue, but lately operating systems are being subtlety designed more and more to prevent choice. You can read more about this delima in my article "[My transition from Windows to Linux in an anti-customer age](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-transition-windows-to-linux/)" (I still service computers that have Windows, but I no longer use Windows as my everyday driver).

I used to use many closed source products for my creativity, Mainly Adobe products, but they are also creating there own ecosystems that prevent choice so I work very hard now to use software that is not owned and controlled by any one company. Its been my experience, when the profit incentive is limited in the product, development of software tends to move in a direction of enabling choice for the user. When profit motives are deeply invested in software, there seems to be a change in direction at some point to give users less choice to keep the profit margins going for investors. I have found that this stifles innovation and harms the [common good - the procedural formulations definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good). I understand profit as an end of good will, not solely a means to get a personal outcome. If the means is put before the end, that usually tends to corrupt the endeavor. "The end justifies the means" is at the heart of this problem. A heart based outcome cannot be experienced for the common good by following this philosophical standpoint.
