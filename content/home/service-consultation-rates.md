Consultations always start as assessments of your issue, that **may** lead to a repair or resolution of your issue. I collect my full minimum fee if you decide not to accept my repair or resolution results.  In some cases, if some service, 3rd party result, or product is not available, or the service cannot be performed in a manner I find acceptable, I will offer you a recommendation in place of a repair or resolution. My full service minimum fee for this time are collected for assessments as well as results.  If your issue was not resolvable due to a missing service, product, or 3rd party result I will apply half of the fee I collected from the original appointment as a credit to the next visit.

I excel at repairing and resolving most technical issues in a timely and cost effective manner. Technology has many operational aspects that are not always apparent at first glace and may require additional billable visits that requiring further time and expense to resolve. Please note that In these situations I will do my best to keep costs and time required to resolve your issue at a minimum. 
  
Consultations can happen in my office, or at your location. Depending on my service load, at-office/home appointments usually carry a scheduling buffer of 3 hours to 1 day. In some cases, 3 days to 1 week. [Contact me](/#contact) for more information.
