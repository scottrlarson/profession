&lt;li&gt;#1 - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bleeping ComputerÂ® is a information security and technology news publication created in 2004. Millions of visitors come to BleepingComputer.com every month to learn about the latest security threats, technology news, ways to stay protected online, and how to use their computer more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to news, we provide a wide array of free technical support services, downloads, and self-education tools that allow a user to resolve issues on their computer. Whether you are a novice user here to learn basic concepts about computers or an advanced user infected with ransomware, BleepingComputer can offer custom solutions to your problem for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of it&amp;rsquo;s focuses is also to allow the novice computer to have a place that they can come and discuss computer/technology problems with their peers and at the same time have a rich resource in which to learn the &amp;ldquo;basics&amp;rdquo; about computers and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have found, with extensive experience in helping users that most technical support problems lie not with the computer, but with the fact that the user does not know the &amp;ldquo;basic concepts&amp;rdquo; that underlie all issues of computing. Once a user learns the basic concepts of technology they will be able to express what problems they are having in a more understandable manner, making it easier to be helped by a more experienced user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic concepts of computer technology do not only apply themselves towards fixing problems, but also to every day life. In today&amp;rsquo;s age, computers are here to stay and are only going to be incorporated into our daily life more and more as time goes on. Understanding the basic concepts will allow you to communicate more intelligently about your computer and technology needs and allow you to use your equipment more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, their goal is to turn your #$@!* computer that never does what you want, to one that you praise as a well tamed tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;#3 - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ifixit.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iFixit is a wiki-based site that teaches people how to fix almost anything. Anyone can create a repair manual for a device, and anyone can also edit the existing set of manuals to improve them. The site empowers individuals to share their technical knowledge with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the ifixit site for disassembly reference for laptops. But I also purchase parts from the site I cannot find anywhere else. I support&lt;/p&gt;
