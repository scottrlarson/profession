## The best security is awareness

Many security measures can help protect your device, but when you become the target, awareness, and education is your best defense. In the last five or ten years, as computer security keeps getting better, many attackers have moved from computer infiltration to targeting _you_ through what's called a "Social Engineering Attack". A term used to encompass a broad range of malicious activities to extort money from you. 

Social engineering attacks happen in one or more steps:
 
1. An attacker does background research on a set of victims in a specific demographic. The goal is to target the most vulnerable people of society, like the elderly. 
2. Vulnerabilities are discovered. 
3. Armed with the necessary information from step one and two, the attacker uses psychological manipulation in the form of a pointed written message, or phone conversation, to trick you into giving away sensitive information.

Attackers will likely attempt to trick you with a message that conveys an [**illusion of authority**](#terms), and a sense of urgency. As an example, you may get a pop-up on your screen that your computer has been compromised, asking you to urgently call a number. You might get an email stating that you are required by law to make contact with a government representative because the IRS didn't receive your tax return, or you might even get a call from the attacker, without any action on your part, claiming to be working for Microsoft and that your computer is unprotected.

With any unfamiliar situation, remember to take a deep breath and relax. 99% of communications that attempt to compel you to act with the above tactics are false. These kinds of attacks are most successful when you are in a state of panic. Legitimate business dealings happen on their own with no outside coercion. If at any time you feel forced to perform an action, step back, regroup, and gather information from outside sources. In these circumstances, you never, ever, have to take an immediate action. You always have recourse, but it takes time and patience to find alternatives. 

The most likely indicators of a social engineering attack include:

- **Urgency**: A communication that expresses a tremendous sense of urgency, often through fear, intimidation, a crisis, or an important deadline. Attackers can be good at creating convincing messages that appear to come from an authority, or even someone you know.  
- **Pressure**:  A message that creates a sense of "No Option". The language indicates that you must act right away, and many interactions will even attempt to get you to bypass or ignore security measures designed to protect you, such as giving out your password to your online bank account.
- **Illusion of Authority**: A author or caller who uses an authoritative tone of voice or a written strong-worded message. This kind of interaction can be framed in many ways, but it works best when an attacker impersonates an agent from a government establishment or a reputable company. The attacker will attempt to use language that sounds authoritative to gain a position of superiority over you. The ultimate goal is to get you to perform an action that, on the surface, appears to benefit you.

## The psychology behind decision making

It's good to learn a bit about your decision-making process. Recognize your particular temperament when it comes to obstacles and challenges. Ask yourself these questions: 

- How do you hold up under pressure? 
- Do you need to avoid circumstances that lead you to make snap decisions? 
- Can you practice breathing, and walking away?

Contemplate on these questions and make a reminder or a mental note for any future dealings with aggressive queries.


## Avoiding Scams

### Search Results

**Skipping Ads with an Adblocker**

To avoid Ad listings in search results entirely, you can use a reputable Adblocker. Be aware that not all adblockers are created equal, some disguise themselves as adblockers, but instead deliver Ad's to your computer. I use the [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/) add-on/extension in Firefox and Google Chrome. It strips out Ad related content from many search engine results. This is the most effective way to protect you from malicious search results. Do not worry about losing any important results. Ad results are only companions to organic search results. If a result shows up in an Ad. I will show up in the search result if it is relevant to the search term. You might run into an occasion where you might need to whitelist a particular site from being blocked, and you can do that through the settings of the adblocker.

**Avoiding Ads with Knowledge**

If you do not want to use an Adblocker you can avoid malicious Ad results by knowing what to look for. The image below shows how Google, Yahoo, and Bing layout their Ad based search results. Headings highlighted in red contain the Ad listings. 

![Ad Laden Search Result Example 1](/img/publications/scam-avoidance/search-results-ads.png)

Search sites like those listed above have a platform for submitting Ads. This allows any "Joe" to create Ad campaigns that link directly to every day relevant search terms. 

<div class="content-block-wrap"><a href="/img/publications/scam-avoidance/google-advertising-policies.png"><img src="/img/publications/scam-avoidance/google-advertising-policies.png" alt="Google's Advertising Policies Screenshot"></a> </div>

Google has a reporting system for malicious Ads, but by the time Google gets around to correcting the problem, you can be tricked into visiting a malicious site, and if you interact with that site, by then it's usually too late. In some cases, your device can be compromised without any interaction.

<a href="/img/publications/scam-avoidance/Browly-scam.png"><img src="/img/publications/scam-avoidance/Browly-scam.png" alt="Browly Scam Example 1"></a>

Search results that are labeled "Ad" (See screen-shot above) can be redirected to an alternate site. This means that if you click on a link that you know is reputable, Google inserts itself in the middle and hijacks that link to send you to another location on the Internet. 

Ultimately you want to avoid any of the search results that fall under the label "Advertisement". Watch out for changes, many search engines change the way Ads are delivered on the search results page. Ad labeled search results usually appear at the top, a list of results can appear under one heading labeled "Advertisements", or the label is tagged to each result itself. 

Organic search results are ones that are not commercially supported and as such are less likely to have shenanigans attached to them.

### Pop-up Warnings or Error Messages

Within the scope of normal computer use, legitimate warnings or error messages never include phone numbers. Some specific business applications, like Quickbooks, are the exception. 

If you receive an error message, or warning on your screen that you cannot get out of, do not interact with it in any way. Instead, you could immediately **shutdown the computer** by way of the **power button**. You can power down the computer by **holding the power button down for 5-10 seconds and waiting until the screen goes black**. Please note that there is a slight chance of data loss when you shutdown your computer in this fashion, but if you cannot get your computer to respond to a shutdown or restart command, or use the Task Manager to kill the task in question, it is my understanding these are the only options.

### Call-based Scams

The trick to handling inbound call scams is to realize that, under most circumstances, obtaining computer support requires that you initiate the contact by your own means. When you receive an unsolicited call, claiming to be from any legitimate establishment with the intent to offer you any kind of support, hang up. It's that simple. Remember to maintain awareness of your decision-making psychology and don't put yourself into situations that cause you to make snap decisions.

Do not make outbound calls from any error or warning message that appears on your screen. Remember the 3 indicators of a social engineering attack: **Urgency**, **Pressure**, and **Illusion of Authority**.

### Email-based Scams

![Microsoft Office365 Email Scam](/img/publications/scam-avoidance/scam-email-thunderbird.png)

Making decisions on how to respond to emails that ask you to perform an action can be tricky. There are two categories of inbound emails from any provider:

1. Legitimate requests to review information about your accounts or services.
2. Illegitimate scams that attempt to portray themselves as legitimate requests.

When you receive an email asking you to perform an action, keep in mind the three basic qualifiers of legitimacy: 

1. **Who** is the email sender? Are you receiving an email from Microsoft asking you about your email? Do you even have an email with Microsoft? Find out who your mail provider is. If it's not Microsoft, delete the message. If you do have an Email with Microsoft move on to the next step.
2. **What** is the message asking me to do? Depending on the request, you can sometimes tell that the message is suspect by the way the message is crafted, or by the nature of the request. If the email states that an account you own is on hold because of a billing problem and the message requests that you click on a link to remedy the problem, instead, open up your web browser and visit the site by using **[web browser](#terms)** to confirm that problem exists. 
3. **Where** will I land if I act? Without clicking on any links in the email, move your mouse over the link and look at the destination URL. If it doesn't contain a recognizable location, you know you got a problem.

## Post-Scam

If you have already been a victim of an scam. The first thing to do is to stop the interaction with the attacker. If you have given the attacker access to your technology, shutdown the device and contact me for free evaluation. In most cases its safer to [**factory restore**](#terms) the device.

## Protect your on-line accounts
If you have already had one or more of your accounts hacked, or you want to protect yourself in the future, read my "[Protecting Your Smartphone From Being Hacked](/publications/publication-smartphone-protection/)" which delves into advanced 2 factor authentication methods. Many online services still use the insecure smartphone text based method, which is really a liability instead of a strength. If your thinking about purchasing an identity theft protection service, read my publication "[What is Identity Theft Protection, and do you need it?](/publications/publication-id-theft-what-why/)"

## Conclusion

My goal in this publication was to attempt to make you aware of some of the common ways in which a scammer operates, but there may be other methods that are outside of its scope. When dealing with solicited requests for information, don't be afraid to err on the side of caution. It's better to be safe, then sorry.
