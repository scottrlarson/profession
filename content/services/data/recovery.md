## Data Recovery
It's very likely that I can recover data from your damaged device, or your data loss. The chances of recovery depend on a number of factors: If you own a Hard Disk Drive, or Solid State Storage device. The state of the damage on the device, or if you data was deleted, or wiped.  Its important that you stop using your device immediately after you notice any data loss, or failure, as further use could prevent a full recovery. I will need to perform an analysis on your device, to confirm that data can be recovered.

- Data Recovery turn-Around times and costs can vary. Turn-around times can take between 1 day to 3 weeks depending on my time constraints, and the state of your device. If physical damage exists on your device, the particular damage may significantly slow your device's recovery time. Check below for price ranges.
- The recovery fee portion covers a full recovery of the data you need.



###  Supported Storage Devices

- Hard Disk Drives
- Solid State Drives

<div class="alert-container">The initial analysis includes a damage report and a quote to recovery the data. Turn-around time from analysis to recovery can rage between 1-3 days, or 1 to 3 weeks depending on the extent of the damage. In rare cases, due to the nature of the systemic damage, certain recovery cases may take 1-3 months for research, testing and full recovery. If I cannot recover the data you need, you only pay the analysis fee.</div>

## Password/System Recovery

If you are unable to access your device, or data, I can help you gain access the to data, or equipment. 

You must own the equipment, or have power of attorney to act on the owners behalf. I will need documentation confirming that you purchased the equipment, or a document stating that you have authority to act on behalf of the owner to allow me to service the equipment.
