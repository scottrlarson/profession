Due to my particular field, being an essential service to the public, I am remaining in operation. I am a one man shop in isolation, and I operate by appointment, which allows me to control the stream of customers, I am taking every precaution necessary to prevent the spread of this virus.

{{< srl-alert >}}Please note that if you have a working internet connection, and your device is responsive, I can handle your issue with my <a href="/services/computer/assistance/online">Online Repair & Resolution Service</a> without a visit.{{< /srl-alert >}}

I have created the following procedures to minimizing the handling of your device: 

1. I am using disposable Vinyl Gloves when handling the device. 
2. Once the device is in my office, I immediately hook it up to my attached Keyboard, Video & Mouse environment. This allows me to access the device without having to physically be at the device itself. 
3. When the servicing is complete, I wipe down the outside of the device with 70% Ethyl Rubbing Alcohol.

{{< srl-alert >}}Please do not order any services if you, or, in the case of a at-location appointment, anyone in your household has shortness of breath, or has signs of any flu like symptoms.{{< /srl-alert >}}

## Drop-off In-Office Service
You can drop off your device at my office. To maintain social distancing during this crisis, I can pick up your device directly from the curbside of my office building. I can also pick up your device from your curbside, there is a $50 pick up/drop off fee in additional to any other fees for that service that I will collect up front for my time. If you want to minimize contact and/or speed up the process of the exchange, print, fill out my [authorization form](https://www.dropbox.com/s/odow1lxexadhd0a/srl-authorization-form_savable.pdf?dl=0). You can present it to me with your device. Give me call or text me to setup a time for the exchange:

## In-office Consultations 
I am seeing one customer at a time, by appointment. Walk-in customers who show up while I am with a customer, will be asked to phone me to make an appointment.

## At-Location Appointments
To protect our households, I will arrive wearing a mask and gloves, so please do not be alarmed. When an appointment is scheduled to visit your home or office, or when you visit my office for a consultation to provide a service, we agree to maintain three-six feet distance and wear masks to protect each-other. In the case of a at-location appointment, at your request, I will wipe down any equipment with 70% rubbing alcohol after I have completed the service, otherwise I expect you to protect yourself by doing your own cleaning after I leave the location.
