      <description>In 2017, Microsoft implemented data collection into it&amp;rsquo;s Windows 10 Operating System. Due to the negative effects that this practice has on customer privacy, I offer a decluttering service to remove and disable certain unnecessary and unwanted functions.* ** Here is what this service provides:
 I disable all Telemetry and Data Collection services. I uninstall all Microsoft Windows 10 apps, except the basic, or useful ones that would prevent the normal operation of the device: Mail, Microsoft Store, Calculator, Sticky, Windows.</description>

I deliver to you a list of devices that can future-proof your on-device productivity. You get exactly what you need without the time required to educate yourself on the specifics of hardware price-to-quality ratio.
