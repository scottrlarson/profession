Many technology firms will recommend upgrading Windows 7 to Windows 10. Truth be told, in most cases, the hardware in that older computer is not recent enough to support an upgrade like this. It can be done, but you may find, in a short amount of time, that the computer operates slower than it ever had. Don't bother wasting time an money on a upgrade that is just going to be worthless in a few months time. 

Talk to me about upgrading your device to a newer model. I can analyze your current device for upgrade compatibility and performance. Depending on the results, I can offer an upgrade path that is going to make you more productive, not less. [Contact](/#contact) me for a free recommendation on an upgrade path now. Don't buy into upgrading Windows 7 with 10 until you can get an assurance that your hardware can support it.
