Commodore, instrumental in launching the Home Computer movement forward, focused on low cost alternatives to the high end, high price market that the juggernauts Apple and IBM were involved in at the time. [Commodore's decisions around the development of the Home Computer launched many innovations forward that made the computer entertainment industry what it is today.](https://www.bitmapbooks.com/blogs/news/back-to-basic-understanding-the-dazzling-legacy-of-the-commodore-64). 

>*We build computers for the masses, not the classes*.  
- Jack Tramiel (Commodore's Founder).

The C64 was my first computer, if you were using computers at the time, it was likely your first computer to. Simplicity, low cost, superior graphics, quality sound, good game software and aggressive marketing made the C64 the perfect home computer for enthusiasts like me and many others.

Tinkering communities formed around the C64's simple design and broad software support. It was a bit like the cassette tape area. Enthusiasts like me became fascinated with exploring and tinkering with the C64's capabilities by testing the limits of hardware, playing with software that did cool things and sharing it with the community.

The C64 inspired a whole slew of independent software designed for people who wanted to share their creations.

Like the first mission to the moon, the technology behind the Amiga 500 Home Computer changed everything. The A500 had it's beginnings at Atari. An engineer, Jay Miner, had an idea to develop a computer that would revolutionize games and make them much easier to develop. 

Too afraid of losing money, Atari corporate executives of that time (this still happens today in many other fields of computer technology) put little-to-no energy into paradigm shifting innovations. This decline was in the process of causing the console industry to collapse. Game development relied heavily on licensing expensive hardware. Due to the fear of losing these deals, Atari prohibited Jay from perusing this new platform. Jay left Atari, and a previous co-worker helped him revive the idea under a new company. The A500's hardware design shifted the technological paradigm of the time. Suddenly, no longer bound monochrome displays and single tone beeps, studio quality video and sound became a reality.  Eventually Commodore bought the platform and marketed the computer towards creative people. The A500 became a big hit with computer enthusiasts and entertainment professions all over the world.  

### Expandability
One of the big selling points of Home Computers was upgradability. Game consoles purchased for the home during that time were solid units, meaning the design principles where static and the hardware couldn't be changed after the unit was manufactured.

The A500 was one of the first computers release with a open design principle allowing expandability. It had two expansion slots that accepted hardware expansion devices like hard drives and other peripherals. Also, instead of all the chips being soldiered into the mainboard directly, the chips were mounted onto bases so they could be easily removed and replaced when improvements where made. 

This kind of open architecture was a first for computer enthusiasts, similar to the concept of modularity, parts could be removed, replaced and upgraded. For me, that was what really made home computers interesting. I learned how the logic between components in a computer worked, from a conceptual standpoint, by expanding the capabilities of my  computer which spurred my continued learning over the years.

Without out this kind of open access to the hardware, I would have never learned how to service computers. Currently, some current mobile technology like phones, tablets and laptops are being designed around the static and unchanging aspects of the console era of the 1980's. Creating a throw-away culture completely dependent on the decisions on for-profit companies that have no interest in open platforms. Consider supporting the [right to repair](https://www.repair.org/stand-up) movement and [ending creative monopolies](https://www.endcreativemonopolies.com/).

### The Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The Graphical User Interface changed the way in which a computer is operated. It was the first time I realized I could be creative without having to code. I realized that I could create art with a computer through the gestures of my hand. Instead of learning more about the computer itself via programming or electronics, I went in a different direction. I like the concepts of programming and electronics, but I am much more of a visual person so I prefer designing.

Using a GUI to interact with a computer is like an extension of human perception. As humans, we interact with our environment by the senses. Like an extension between the body and mind, the more intuitive the tool, the more fluid and imaginative one can be with the tool. Imagination and creativity impacts how the world is perceived. The A500 inspired a whole slew of [creative endeavors](https://www.indiegamewebsite.com/2018/10/19/the-complete-history-of-indie-games/) in more creative fields than I can count. Because of this innovation, everything our modern computers are based on owes its beginnings to The Amiga platform. 

If we go back to the C64 days, computers received instructions from a Command Line Interface (CLI), I.E typing commands to launch programs and work with everyday tasks. There were some limited GUI interfaces that you could load on top of the CLI, but nothing on the scale that the A500 implemented. The whole OS was grounded in a GUI from start to finish, way before Microsoft's Windows operating system was released. It's difficult to quantify the impact the GUI had on my life. Switching between a lifetime of CLI, to a GUI is like miraculously being able to see after years of being blind. 

I believe that the GUI for computing accelerated adoption of computers.  For many people that might have been put-off by command line, the GUI made using computers more intuitive helping to spawn a golden age of digital art and sound.
