Playing video online or off smoothly has some minimum hardware requirements if you want to avoid hassles:

1. Processor: 2.4 Ghz Dual Core Processor.
2. Graphics Card: 256 MB VRAM, 600Mhz Core Clock
3. RAM: 4 GB

If you do not know what specifications your device has, there are a few ways to check, on a PC the easiest way is to open a Run Dialog Box. Hold the Windows key down and press 'R'. A prompt should come up. Type 'msinfo32'. Look for the hardware system requirements above. If your specs are below the above, then you will not be able to play videos smoothly. Please note that "single core" processors are below the minimum specifications need to play video regardless of the speed. "dual core", "quad core", and above clock speeds may be below the minimum because the processors "in-total" averages above 2.4.
