Smartphones are like the life line between you and your services. These little communicators are being used as part of an effort by online services to verify you are you. Unfortuantley, if that little device becomes compromised, it's very difficult to undo the damage. Personal details about you, like your name, address, and phone number are like children, they become attached to your identity for a long, long time. If a shady character gains access to your mobile account and smartphone, they can gain access to other areas of your life as well.

When your bank asks you for your mobile phone number, to send you a text message with a cryptic code to view your dollars online, who's to say that this text message is really going to be delivered to you? If this pilferer has a reason to do you in, your mobile account information can be the gateway this pillager needs to forward those text messages to a Smartphone they own instead. Then,  this plunderer can login as you, go though that well known "Forgot Password" recovery process and send a text message (with your bank account login info) to this counterfeit Smartphone. One way this theft is perpetrated on you is though what's called a "Sim Card Swap". (No, this is not related to your Sim Game Character) If this looser can find out certain details about you, then it's possible to contact your mobile provider and get them to transfer your mobile account to a phone this marauder owns. There are security methods carriers are suppose to follow to confirm your who's who, but a smart swindler can find ways around that security.

I spoke to a person over the phone that wanted to know what to do, she lost her phone for a few hours. Later on, it turned up, but something strange started happening. Someone was posting suspect messages to her Facebook account, as her. It turned out that the likely culprit was another party in a court case she was party to. I bet an interested party was attempting to get the court to question her character by making discrediting remarks through her online presence. She hand already handled her problem though, by purchasing a new phone and sim card. She also discontinued using the email account the hacker gained access to, but since the attacker had access to her account, and she could not verify her own identity any more (because she forgot the security questions), she lost access to her email. Write down those answers to your security questions. Its a real pain to try and convince an email provider to gain access to your account after its be compromised if you forgot the security questions.

After [AT&T lost a $24 million lawsuit](https://www.coindesk.com/att-fails-to-win-dismissal-in-24-million-crypto-sim-swap-lawsuit), many in the online services industry started to question the use of the text messaging as the  identity police.

Two new technologies to police identities of online accounts were release early this year to combat theses kinds of attacks under the umbrella of what's called 2-factor authentication: A Smartphone app and a USB/Bluetooth security key. The Smartphone app works by installing a authenticator app on your smart-phone. [Google Authenticator App](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en), or [Microsoft's Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator) are two from well known sources. There is also an [open source](/updates/update-why-open-source-matters-freedom) app [FreeOTP](https://freeotp.github.io/). USB/Bluetooth Security keys are similar to using a key to lock your physical property. It adds a physical layer of protection to your on-line sign-in's. It works by plugging in a flash drive looking device into the USB port of your desktop or laptop. Or pressing a button on a blue-tooth connected security key to authenticate via a mobile device.

In my mind both of these technologies are twins in terms of how they protect your identity, so you do not get locked out of your account if your forget one of the two. Not all Security Key packages offer the same choices, so it's a good idea to [look at the options](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235173/the-best-hardware-security-keys-yubico-titan-key-u2f) each package provides to be sure the Key you purchase is going to work with your particular setup.

Think of having a secure way to access your accounts as an insurance policy. You might never get attacked, but if you do, having a way to confirm your identity (other than a single password, that can be very easy to compromise) is a smart idea. As we put more and more of our life on-line, protecting your identity is going to increasingly become an issue.

## How to protect your Smartphone from being attacked:

### 1. Don’t break-up with your smartphone until you are ready

Don't walk away from your Smartphone locked, or unlocked, until its for good. If it's for good see "6. Other Smartphone protection hoopla" As an added measure of tranquility, configure your smartphone to lock automatically after five minutes, or less. Don't lend your smartphone to friends, family, or your cat. I know you trust your cat, but lending your smartphone out for even a few minutes, or hours adds to that quality of "What I don't know, does hurt me". No person is as careful with your stuff as you. If you need to demo a photo, video, or otherwise on your smartphone, make sure you maintain physical contact of the smartphone at all times. I'm totally not kidding here, well mostly. It's easy to forget you left your Smartphone with your cat.

### 2. Mix those passwords up
Don't be a copycat. Create a unique password or PIN for your smartphone that you do not use anywhere else. Or better yet if you have a lot of login drama, consider using a [Password Manager](http://www.scottrlarson.com/recommendations/recommendation-password-managers). Password Manager's help minimize password dementia. These little pieces of software can generate complex passwords that you do not have to remember. And it can auto-type your logins to boot. Many can share the password love by being available across your personal devices. From your Desktop to the Laptop. From your smartphone to your tablet, Password Managers keep your password life in sync. Do not use the name of your cat as the Password Manager's Login. It's really important to secure that database from cat name thief's. Your passwords deserve better. [Contact me](/#contact) if you need help choosing, or setting up one of these baby's.

### 3. Maintain your up-to-date-ness
Your mobile device is like your car. It only runs well when you keep it fine-tuned. Mobile OS's and applications are updated on a regular basis. Ensure that you follow your mobile update orders private.

### 4. Public hotspots are like unprotected sex
Be smart about how you use a unprotected network like a hotspot. It's great for checking news, maybe not so great for logging into your bank.

### 5. Stick to the tried and true
Don't Jailbreak you smartphone, or let a friend convince that you need some special app isn't in your app store, unless you want to be hacked. In that, good luck with that.

          <li>**Do not modify the smartphone’s security settings**: Check what permissions are required before installing any apps, and be careful that access to sensitive information is not being granted if it's not necessary for the app in question.</li>
          <li>**Apply encryption** to the internal memory card and – if possible – to any sensitive data held; If you back-up your device to another location, make sure that backup is encrypted.</li>
          <li>**Ensure ‘Bluetooth’ is switched off if not required.**</li>
          <li>**Think before clicking** on web links, or attachments in emails, or text messages – if you are not sure who the message is coming from, or the message is coming from someone you know that would never send you that kind of information, or that person would never make this kind of contact with you, ignore the message and delete it.</li>
          <li>**Secure Erase that Old Device**: Ensure that the smartphone is securely recycled, donated or disposed of – e.g. erase all data first, reset it to the factory settings; remove the SIM card.</li>
          <li>**Report a lost or stolen phone ASAP**: If the smartphone is lost or stolen, report it  as soon as possible to your mobile provider.</li>
          <li>**Set a PIN on your SIM card**: Most smartphones have the ability to set a PIN code on the SIM card itself. If your SIM card, or smartphone gets compromised, the attacker will be required to enter a PIN code to unlock the capabilities of the SIM card, unless the smartphone is powered on and unlocked at the time it has been compromised. (Shutting down or restarting your smartphone will require you to enter in this PIN in addition to whatever password you have setup on the smartphone itself.</li>

In my experience, the best security (Smartphone or otherwise) is awareness. Being aware of what you know (and don't know) about your technology is one step for man, and one giant leap for mankind. Have some peace of mind about where you stand with security. If you don't know how to proceed on any of these areas, [contact me](/#contact) and I can help you formulate a master plan. My goal is to be that link in the chain that frees you up to live your life, while I help you in the background maintain proper security of your devices, now and in the future.
