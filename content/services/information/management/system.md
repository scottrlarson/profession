I provide home and small office management services for security, backup and maintenance of your computer, or computers. Service include monitoring and maintenance of the reliable operation of your computers by maintaining robust security, maintenance, and disaster recovery solutions. This service frees you from having to maintain these important areas yourself. Just like a car, over time, and use, computers require regular maintenance and fresh look at these important areas of your digital life. If your computer is not maintained (Updating Software, and monitoring security and backups) problems can crop up, and many times you wont even know it until it's too late.

{{% accordion title="Why would I want system management?" id="spec-case"  %}}
I had one customer that thought his special accounting data was being backed up by Carbonite, but due to the way in which the application accessed the data, it prevented the Carbonite from accessing, and backing up the data while the application was running. Since the application was open most of the time, the data was not being backed up. The customer had to rebuild that particular data set from scratch.
      
If needed, I take an inventory of your applications and data sets to look for potential problems and come up with a custom action plan that meets your specific needs.
      
If you have special cases that needs attention, I can sit down with you, and find out what's most important to maintain. I provide solutions that aim to prevent catastrophic loss of critical data. I do this by  monitoring your system's performance, reliability, and security on a monthly basis, update software when necessary, tweak scan and backup schedules to run at opportune times, recommend replacement hardware. This allows me to possibly alert you of a pending failure, or possibly trigger a backup before a loss occurs.
      
But even if you have simple needs, don't let the maintenance of your current system slip though the cracks of a upgrade.

## Disaster Recovery Backup Hardware Requirement Costs

{{% alert %}}If you have a current security or backup solution this service would be a replacement. {{% /alert %}}

Depending on your needs, you might need:

- A **reliable USB storage device**: Lacie Rugged Portable HDD 2TB (If required) - $150.00 Per System

\- or -     

- A **NAS(Network Attached Storage)** for multiple computers - $700.00 (Provides local in-home/office network backup's of all your systems, or network access to your files) - An NAS installation usually requires a network site survey service ($400.00) to audit your current networking hardware to confirm that your it's meets the specified requirements for a NAS.

The full system management package is $520.00 per year - averaging out to $45.00 Monthly. It includes all software, and monitoring of your security, upkeep and backup. Alternatively, you can purchase individual packages if you feel you don't need one particular service, but I strongly recommend the entire package for total system security.

## Support

Individual support issues are handled on an individual bases, or by contract. Can check my [rates](/#rates) for more information. 

## Terms
- The **Security, Upkeep, and Backup System Management** services covers the installation and upkeep of each service. I remotely manage and customize the service's settings to help prevent most problems from causing system downtime or loss of data. If a problem is identified during my normal monitoring, I will contact you and let you know a normal servicing needs to happen, and we can talk about [fees](/#rates) or I can send you a quote of service. 
- The **Upkeep portion** is a service that helps prevent downtime by identifying potential problems to your hardware and software before they cause catastrophes.
- The **Backup portion** is a service that helps prevent backup failures from happening and with the upkeep monitoring portion may enable me to trigger a backup before a catastrophe in many cases.
- The **Security portion** is a service that in most cases helps prevent threats from causing damage to your system or data.

### Definitions

- **S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) **is a monitoring system included in computer hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and eMMC drives. Its primary function is to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability with the intent of anticipating imminent hardware failures. When remotely monitoring S.M.A.R.T. It's possible to detect imminent storage drive failures, so preventative action can be taken to prevent data loss, the failing drive can be replaced and data integrity maintained. 

- **Backup redundancy** protects your data from data loss. In the instance of a local backup if you system is lost or taken a cloud backup would protect you against theft or loss.


- As of 2020 I use **Macrium Reflect as a Backup** and Disaster recovery solution. It is a reliable and well a tested product for making regular backups and restores of both system and personal data. Macrium Software was founded in 2006 when CEO and Founder Nick Sills experienced a personal data disaster and in the process discovered existing backup tools were not as good as he expected. Wanting a software solution that was practical and easy to use, Nick and his team developed Macrium Reflect to create a safe and secure disk image with ultra-fast recovery times should disaster strike.

- This Management service **does not cover costs of installation or replacement hardware**, if any.
