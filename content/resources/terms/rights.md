## Right to Refuse or Halt Service and Change My Mind

All my rights as a individual who services the public are reserved. I reserve the right to: refuse to accept you as a new customer, halt work in progress if I feel like my time is being taken advantage of by being abusive verbally, in writing or in person. I am one person with many customers, I will do my best to keep you up to date on the work I am doing, but certain circumstances can cause the work length to be different than what I originally specified or more than you can bear, ranging from a couple of days to a couple of weeks. <!--more-->

If you can not wait that long for your device to be serviced please seek a firm that has many technicians that can offer a quicker turn around time. I do offer limited device loaner options if stock is available. Please make an inquiry if you need a loaner machine when you bring your device in to be serviced.

## Right to Charge (Government Agents or Otherwise)

If you work for any government entities or are being contracted by any entity that has a relationship to a government entity where you are ordered to observe or obtain records about my service operations I reserve the right to charge you directly if your inquiry requires me to act to protect my rights, or act on any order or requirement you communicate to me that takes time out of my work day or interferes with my rights in any way. I reserve the right to answer exclusively in writing to any order or notice that requires me to respond. Regardless of what entity you work for, or what you are asked to do, you are always liable for your actions whether it's on behalf of another or the result of your own decision.
