My first experience with computers started in the early 1980's on one of the first home computers, the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A. I was about 12 years old. Relatively expensive, but affordable to average person, Home Computers ranged around a thousand dollars in value.

Due to the expense, not many families had a personal computer back then. Fortunately we had a friend who's mother must have saw the value in kids playing with computers and had the resources to purchase one for her son. The reasons why I will never know as I lost contact with them. "**Tunnels of Doom**" became the hot title at the time. As far as I know, it was the first multi-player turn-based [dungeon crawler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_crawl) released at that time. We started our morning loading in the cassette and pushing the play button so the computer could read our previous save game data from the weekend before. After several hours and a home cooked dinner our game would be loaded. We each took our respective turns exploring a procedurally generated dungeon together, engaging in battles with monsters and restoring fallen comrades. I remember it being the first continuous game experience that would last more than one sitting where I learned to cooperate with other players to complete objectives.

A few years after my experience with the TI994a. My parents notice my enthusiasm in science and computers. I think they wanted to turn me into a scientist and saw the home computer as a step up from my childhood dream of getting myself into trouble. 

A quick side note, I had brief introduction into electronics theory and practicalities by my Uncle Jim, who worked as a electrician in WWII, and later became a city electrician. On occasion, when my parents went away on vacation, they would ship me to Chicago to visit my Uncle. He showed me the basics of the apprentice craft. A few years of my life was spent in his basement, building small electronic devices together. Maybe that's why I jump at the prospect of getting my hands on newly released gadgets today.  

As far as electronics go, the computer was, and is, a different beast. Obviously, the inner workings of a computer operates on the same principles of electric current. But what made home computers different from electronics is the software programming aspect of it. Programming is like creating a list of instructions for something to happen. When a computer receives a list of instructions, at the end of the day, is really all about flipping switches. Flipping a sequence of switches actually, in a way the computer can understand.

Anyways, this enthusiasm got me my first computer, a Commodore 64. I'm skipping the part where my real first computer was a TRS-80. Because, well, if you didn't know, back then, it was considered the [Trash 80](https://dfarq.homeip.net/trash-80-what-it-meant-and-why-it-stuck/) by my compadres, and I don't want to mar my reputation :P. It was as good of a computer as any during that time, but since it was sold by Radio Shack, I think it developed a bad reputation because Radio Shack's electronics were considered subpar.

Anyways, forget I ever said anything about that. On to the extraordinary achievement of the mid-eighties. I bring you, the Commodore 64!

### Commodore 64

Commodore, instrumental in launching the Home Computer movement forward focused on low cost alternatives to the high end, high price market that the juggernauts Apple and IBM were involved in at the time. [Commodore's decisions around the development of the Home Computer launched many innovations forward that made the computer entertainment industry what it is today.](https://www.bitmapbooks.com/blogs/news/back-to-basic-understanding-the-dazzling-legacy-of-the-commodore-64). 

‘*We need to build computers for the masses, not the classes*.‘ was Commodore’s founder, Jack Tramiel motto.

The C64 was my first computer, if you were using computers at the time, it was likely your first computer to. Simplicity, low cost, superior graphics, quality sound, good game software and aggressive marketing made the C64 the perfect home computer for enthusiasts like me and many others.

Tinkering communities formed around the C64's simple design and broad software support. It was a bit like the cassette tape area. Enthusiasts like me became fascinated with exploring and tinkering with the C64's capabilities by testing the limits of hardware, writing software that does cool things and sharing it with the community.

But the major selling point of the C64 was the low cost for the individual that wanted to design their own programs and games. Back then, designing software was dominated by large companies that either sold software to big business, or manufactures of coin-operated games.

It put the power to create something cool into the hands of regular people. The C64 inspired a whole slew of independent software designed for people who wanted to share their creations.
