## This is Now

### Custom built Computers
I currently build my own computers (Assemble from hardware on the market), but I also repair OEM computers as well.

#### x64 Operating Systems
**Linux**
**Windows**

#### Current software I utilize
I'm a avid supporter of open source software, especially with Microsoft and Apple software. These companies create whats called "[Walled Gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform)", anti-competitive approaches to their respective operating systems. For the average customer of computer products, it might not be a visible issue, but lately operating systems are being subtlety designed more and more to prevent choice. You can read more about this delima in my article "[My transition from Windows to Linux in an anti-customer age](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-transition-windows-to-linux/)" (I still service computers that have Windows, but I no longer use Windows as my everyday driver).

I used to use many closed source products for my creativity, Mainly Adobe products, but they are also creating there own ecosystems that prevent choice so I work very hard now to use software that is not owned and controlled by any one company. Its been my experience, when the profit incentive is limited in the product, development of software tends to move in a direction of enabling choice for the user. When profit motives are deeply invested in software, there seems to be a change in direction at some point to give users less choice to keep the profit margins going for investors. I have found that this stifles innovation and harms the [common good - the procedural formulations definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_good). I understand profit as an end of good will, not solely a means to get a personal outcome. If the means is put before the end, that usually tends to corrupt the endeavor. "The end justifies the means" is at the heart of this problem. A heart based outcome cannot be experienced for the common good by following this philosophical standpoint.

## Conclusion

An ideological divide, created by big business hoping to capitalize on fear the fear of being different tried to control the experience of computer technology came from people that feared and widely misunderstood this movement. They passed this hysteria onto the general public through the media which caused the general public to treat this new technology with suspicion. If you were one of those "Enthusiast" kids, ridicule and shame came with the territory. During the Industrial Revolution, If you weren't doing something productive, something was wrong with you. I didn't want people to think that I was odd, so I developed a cover story to hide my computer gaming obsession by doing something constructive with "That Contraption" as people like to call them.  I learned C64 basic, the coding language at the time and speech synthesizing (Converting text into speech). If all I was doing, was playing games, I was a nobody with no future in everyone's mind.


I imagine most people at the time thought, and maybe currently think now, that computer games are peripheral to what is going on in the world. In fact, I think there was a real stigma to art and entertainment in my childhood years. Everyone in my neck of the woods seemed to want to appear like they were doing something of importance, that usually meant having a good job with some well known corporation, and making sure we appeared to be supporting capitalism. 

Some of that must have rubbed off on me, because to this day, I still feel empty if I am not doing something externally productive with my life. After reflecting on my childhood experiences with computer gaming, I realized that games, and having fun are a basic fundamental of being human. Sound, graphics, and story elements, that reflected the challenges we are facing in modern society created a real impact on my artistic direction and it helped me explore the real problems with our culture's need to [dominate other cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony). There is a great documentary on the independent gaming culture and it's positive impact on the developers of games as they were growing up called "[Gameloading: Rise of the Indies](https://gameloading.vhx.tv/videos/gameloading-stereo)". 

During this time, I was combining what I knew about electronics from my Uncle by adding modifications to my C64 peripherals. A few crude applications I can remember implementing, were to save power of my peripherals and increase the operating speed of disk drives, which usually result in read/write problems. These kinds of modifications to hardware were probably directly related to why I choose a path of building gaming computers for myself and friends when the PC platform became more modular, which eventually inspired me to start my own computer repair business.

In the early seventies, IBM was the Goliath on the Business Computer block. They had a solid sales/marketing team and were selling 5 million dollar mainframe computers to business that could afford them. Thinking that the Home Computer craze was just a fad, they didn't take the revolution seriously. For the world-at-large, the Home Computer revolution didn't start until IBM's customers pressured the company to enter the space. IBM released the first Personal Computer called the "model 5150" more commonly known as the IBM PC. Based on a open architecture design, the 5150 became very popular. Home Computers were mainly controlled by closed designs, so it's unfortunate that it took a major player to change this paradigm, which IBM used to its own advantage to dominate the Home Computer space. IBM struggled to compete with the Home Computer market, dominated by Apple, Commodore and Tandy but by then the open architecture concept changed the game completely. Home Computer companies started offer there own PC clones to stay in the game. Standards in hardware and software designed, based on the open architecture philosophy brought great innovation to the world of Computers and with it, an era of endless possibilities for the hobbyist.

To this day, Microsoft benefited the most from the IBM's decision to open its architecture, as it was chosen as the main operating system for the PC. It's interesting to note that the company is currently moving further and further into closed design territory with Windows 11. There aim appears to be removing customer choice along with the other companies that jumped on that bandwagon in later years like Apple, HP, Dell and others. Many current computer hardware manufacturers and software developers are designing static hardware and software around a [walled garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_platform) perspective. You can see this perspective with the push to cloud software as a service. You can read more about my thoughts around closed designs in the everyday software we use in my "[My transition from Windows to Linux in an anti-customer age](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-transition-windows-to-linux/)" article and the movement to back again to open hardware platforms in my "[Will one repairable laptop change the world?](https://www.scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-future-of-repairability/)" article.
