![Custom m.2 Laptop Thermal Solution](/img/highlights/thermal-solution-modification-montage.jpg)

I perform all types of modifications to improve performance and stability. I also modify hardware configurations to fix a broken parts. I repair mounts, and add thermal solutions that extend the capabilities of many stock computer desktops and laptops.

Modifications are only needed when some aspect of the model doesn't perform to specification and then a custom solution needs to be implemented. I have over 20 years of experience in performing these types of repairs.
