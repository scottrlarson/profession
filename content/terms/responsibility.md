As a professional computer technician, I'm responsible for addressing operational related issues with technology at the time of servicing.

Preexisting unrelated/related software or hardware problems can be revealed at any time during the servicing. Occasionally these problems can be missed during a servicing. These issues can cause pervasive and reoccurring issues that may require follow-up and secondary servicing/intervention to resolve. 

When these rare situations arise, If I spot the issue during my servicing I will reach out to you to let you know of a problem, when this happens, I may need to perform a diagnostic to resolve the issue, I will bill you for my diagnostic time under these circumstances, if you have any questions about these follow up fees, please contact me. Also If the problem is missed during servicing I can address these issues at a later date at my [regular rates](/#service-repair-rates-turnaround). Reoccurring issues that are attributed to the same conditions that caused the original issue, can be handled under a reduced fee (at my discretion). If the issue is closely related to the original issue from a previous servicing, I may reduce the rate in half for the second visit. Also In some rare cases, if there is a third or forth visit, I may reduce my rate to 75% of what I originally charged.

If I intuit that an issue is going to be systemic during a servicing, I may offer a recommendation for a solution, on in lieu of a resolution.
