<p class="titleHeader">2012: <strong>Technology as an Extension of the Human Body</strong><br> <span class="bodyText">Have you ever considered the effect technology has on us as humans? I think about it all the time. On the one hand all of these gadgets I use have a great purpose. I'm able to look up information to help a customer when I'm working, and on my time off I use a tablet to do research on a screenplay I'm writing. It gives me freedom to take all of my books with me on one device so I don't have to lug a ton of research material around with me. It saves space and its easier to access. But on the other hand, the amount of choices I can have when it comes to deciding how to use this technology is something that can cause my brain to freeze. I get stuck on how to proceed because I am working with too many options and I then can get bogged down in finding out which one is going to work the best for me. <!--break--></span></p>
<p class="titleHeader"><span class="bodyText">After a few years of this I have finally come to the realization that in order for me to move forward with my endeavors I need to limit the amount of options I have. I canceled my cell phone, because I can do everything I want to do on my tablet device. I have a ton of computer games that I play and I had to limit the ones in front of me because they were taking up too much of my project time .I had to let go of things that were just taking up space in my brain. When I let go of these things I had more freedom and more time to do what I really needed to be doing. I wonder if other people have these kinds of stories and I would be interested in hearing about them if you would like to email me back. Anyway that being said I'm always trying to find the right balance in my life and so I wanted to email you about some features and services I have completed on my website that have been long over due.</span></p>
<p class="titleHeader">2012: <strong>NEW: <a href="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/net-smartz-crash-test">Net Smartz Crash Test</a></strong><br> <img src="http://www.scottlarsonconsulting.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/product_thumb/images/services/Dark_Alley_by_husz.jpg" alt="Dark Alley" class="img" height="113" width="150"> <span class="bodyText">I keep track on the amount of customers that get hit with infections from fake virus alerts on there computer. Needless to say, the numbers are not pretty. Its not really anyone's fault. The Internet is relatively new technology and with the its open nature you can attract all kinds of people. But just like taking a trip to an unfamiliar country, its important to get your self up to speed on what you might be expecting. That's what my new Net Smartz Crash Test does. Its an online quiz that walks you though what to lookout for and how to keep your computer free of infections. If you don't know what to look out for, and you don't have your computer up to date there is a good chance you can become infected just by visiting legitimate websites like Facebook or the New York Times. The reason why this is possible is that these websites use third parties to serve up advertisements on the pages you often vist. What ends up happening is that a rogue vendor finds its way into that system and exploits it. When you visit your tried and true website you get hit with a pop up explaining that you have a virus and you need to click continue to clean it. After that happens I usually get a call from an unsuspecting individual inquiring about my clean up services. If you want to save money on having your computer fixed, this is a good way to prepare yourself for situations like this.
