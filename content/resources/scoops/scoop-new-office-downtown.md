I have a new office downtown on 5th Street. I share an office building with about 5 other service professionals. My locked office is in the back of the building. This is where I fix devices and perform data recovery. I also consult with the public on a wide variety of solutions from disaster recovery to security and device maintenance. Come say hi, or bounce an idea off me Monday though Saturday 8am to 6pm. Just ring the door bell and I will greet you at the door.
