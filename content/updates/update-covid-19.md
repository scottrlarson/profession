Due to my particular field, and the fact that I am a one man shop in isolation, and I operate by appointment, which allows me to control the stream of customers, I am remaining in operation. I am taking every precaution necessary to prevent the spread of this virus.

<div class="alert-container">Please note that if you have a working internet connection, and your device is responsive, I can handle your issue with my <a href="/services/computer/assistance/online">Online Repair & Resolution Service</a> without a visit.</div>

I have created the following procedures to minimizing the handling of your device: 

1. I am using disposable Vinyl Gloves when handling the device. 
2. Once the device is in my office, I immediately hook it up to my attached Keyboard, Video & Mouse environment. This allows me to access the device without having to physically be at the device itself. 
3. When the servicing is complete, I wipe down the outside of the device with 70% Ethyl Rubbing Alcohol.

## Drop-off At Office Service
You can drop off your device at my office. To maintain social distancing during this crisis I can pick up your device directly from the front entrance of my office building. Just give me call or text me:

## In-office Consultations 
I am seeing one customer at a time, by appointment. Walk-in customers who show up while I am with a customer, will be asked to phone me to make an appointment.

## Social Distancing
When I schedule an appointment to visit your home or office, or when you visit my office for a consultation to provide a service, we agree to maintain six feet distance, and I will be using disposable Vinyl Gloves in handling equipment.
