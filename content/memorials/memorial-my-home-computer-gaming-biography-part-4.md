The Amiga platform brought amazing capabilities in visuals and sound, beyond anything I experienced. The games created during this time ignited my imagination with possibilities. 

My gaming experience on the Amiga platform inspired me to invest my time and energy into graphic design.  When the first 3D modeling software was released for the Amiga Platform, I was one of it's first adopters. Later in life, this field engaged my interest in film and finally writing for film. 

## Amiga games that influenced my life
**The days of Future Wars, Another World & Flashback**

![Future Wars](/img/memorials/games/delphine-software/future-wars/futurewars-cover.jpg)

In 1989 I played **Future Wars**, a science fiction adventure game release on Amiga Platform. Not a big fan of adventure games at the time, I was more interested in the science fictional aspects of the story telling. 

Future Wars might not have been an amazing success like other games at the time, but I love exploring the concept of time travel. What really inspired me about the game is the sound, made possible by the Amiga platform. Sound was a big thing for games back then, which was very limited by the hardware. For some reason, sound and story telling helped me to continue to explore my interests in science, leading to interpersonal contemplation of what the future might be like. Great for my own story telling as I developed an interest in writing for film. I developed an interest in temporal mechanics and cognitive theory, both of which helps shape my understanding of of the world today. The subjects I write about all have their roots in how objective reality and perception has effects on the human mind.

Three years later **Another World** came out. I was in a game store of the time. I picked up this title and looked at the front and back cover. It looked something like this:

The idea of some guy lost and stranded on a foreign planet resonated with me. Probably because I feel that way some times on earth :P. Anyway, it was the first time I saw three dimensional perspective used in a game. Later I found out the developer used rotoscoping to create the cut-scenes. Remember this is a 2d scrolling game mind you. If my memory serves me correctly, 3D perspective in 2d scrolling games was something not even considered at the time.

A few years later, **Flashback**, a game by the same publisher was released that had a similar feel to Another World, but in it's own right, it was its own game. The game followed a similar theme that I was attracted to, A single protagonist, stranded somewhere, must find his way back to himself.

Flashback Soundtrack

Both Another World and Flashback had great instrumental sound tracks. Not only did music, espically music with atmosphiric sound effects  helped me focus on whats happening in the game, it so helps me connect with my surroundings and from that point on, I used music to help me focus on my creativity which seems to steam atmospheric sounds.

Playing these particular games was the first time I experienced liner story telling and that helped me figure out why I was so inspired by stories. I realized that story telling, in the way it was presented in games, as interactive pieces, was a way for me to focus my own decision making in life. As a learned how to make descision in games, I realized with the right focus and intention, I could make sound choices in my own life.

[The Fallout 3 Ambient Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWgXz2PRrTk) is a perfect example of how ambmiance can focus attention 

### Commodore Amiga 2000

Realizing the power of the Amiga platform for graphics and sound I wanted to do more with the technology that just play games. So I purchased an Amiga 2000 with some inheritance money I had to explore the cutting edge capabilities of the platform. 

As Commodore shifted gears with the marketing strategies to appeal directly to business by releasing a model for Graphic Artists. In the early 1990's the [Video Toaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Toaster) was release and this is where people really started to take notice of the platform. The toaster allowed you to combine graphic capabilities with real world captured video, something TV stations were moving toward anyway. Before the release of the Toaster a TV station would spend 10,000 on hardware to make this dream a reality. But now, it was being put into the hands of independent artists. This move spawned a whole new era of creative markets.

### 3D modeling on the Amiga 2000

I came into the 3D scene when I started seeing models being produced by artists. At the time. I was in collage and taking various courses to see where my interests would take me. I thought I might get into 3D graphic design so I purchased the 3d modeling application at the time, **Caligari** which was later renamed to **Truespace 3d**.

Learning 3D modeling helped me shape my ideas and bring my imagination to life, which inspired me in other areas of my life.

## The fall of Commodore as a company and jumping ship
I remember the end of the eighties commodore was struggling to keep up with the technological advancements. research shows that they didn't understand the potential of the Amiga platform and the people behind it. On the ground I just remember that the platform was being limited by somehting as software was not being written for it as many developers started migrated to the PC or Mac platform. I eventually had to jump ship and switche over to a PC platform. I often look back at this time because the Amiga platform was doing things at the time that was ahead of its time, and I often wonder where we would be at now if commedore survived. I think we would be at least 5 or 10 years more advanced than we are now. Because of PC compatibility the technolgoy moves at a slower rate. Apple is less limited by this problem,
