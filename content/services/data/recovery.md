It's very likely that I can recover data from your damaged device, or your data loss. The chances of recovery depend on a number of factors: If you own a Hard Disk Drive, or Solid State Storage device. The state of the damage on the device, or if you data was deleted, or wiped.  Its important that you stop using your device immediately after you notice your loss, or failure, as further use could prevent a full recovery. I will need to perform a free analysis on your device, covering the possibility of recovering your data, and my fees for recovery.

- Data Recovery turn-Around times and costs can vary. Turn-around times can take between 1 day to 3 weeks depending on my time constraints, and the state of your device. If physical damage exists on your device, the particular damage may significantly slow your device's recovery time. Check below for price ranges.
- I offer a recovery guarantee. You only pay if I can recover data you actually need.



## Supported Storage Devices

- Hard Disk Drive
- Solid State Storage
- Flash Memory Storage

<div class="alert-container">The initial analysis includes a damage report and a quote to recovery the data. Turn-around time from analysis to recovery can rage between 1-3 days, or 1 to 3 weeks depending on the extent of the damage. In rare cases, due to the nature of the systemic damage, certain recovery cases may take 1-3 months for research, testing and full recovery. If I cannot recover the data you need, you only pay the analysis fee.</div>

Data Recovery Analysis Fee:

Data recovery rates for a functioning device (device powers on, and is accessible via the hardware interface.):
{{% service-range item-min="$300" item-max="$600" %}}

Data recovery rates for a non-functioning device (Device does not detect, power on, or does power on, but the contents of the file system cannot be read in any meaningful way, necessitating a mechanical failure recovery.):
