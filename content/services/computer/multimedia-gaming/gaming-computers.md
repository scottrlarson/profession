With over 20 years of hardware experience, my custom PC gaming rigs provide you with the right hardware specifications for the games you want to play. I provide a service that offers the best performance/stability that a gaming system can offer.  To keep your system running smoothly you get a 100% guarantee on the operation of the hardware with my well known one-on-one personal support to maintain your state-of-the-art tech.

I started building and upgrading hardware for gaming in the nineties. I was designing gaming machines when the first 3d graphics card was released on the market by 3dfx. I have a long history with how hardware functions in many different configurations. The best part about my skills is my love for putting together a machine that performs. For me it's like building a race car designed for a specific race, or many types of races. I put great care and love into what I do, because I enjoy doing it.

I am able to advise, spec-out, design, custom build and provide support services for gaming platforms of all levels. From the average, to hardcore, or even whole gaming rooms. I provide the skills and knowledge to make hardware and software work for the games you want to play with minimal hassle and downtime.
